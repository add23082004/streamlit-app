</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,<br>
And by the doom of death end woes and all.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE.<br>
Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more.<br>
I am not partial to infringe our laws.<br>
The enmity and discord which of late<br>
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke<br>
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,<br>
Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,<br>
Have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,<br>
Excludes all pity from our threat’ning looks.<br>
For since the mortal and intestine jars<br>
’Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,<br>
It hath in solemn synods been decreed,<br>
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,<br>
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns;<br>
Nay more, if any born at Ephesus<br>
Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs;<br>
Again, if any Syracusian born<br>
Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,<br>
His goods confiscate to the Duke’s dispose,<br>
Unless a thousand marks be levied<br>
To quit the penalty and to ransom him.<br>
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,<br>
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;<br>
Therefore by law thou art condemn’d to die.
</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
Yet this my comfort; when your words are done,<br>
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE.<br>
Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause<br>
Why thou departedst from thy native home,<br>
And for what cause thou cam’st to Ephesus.
</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
A heavier task could not have been impos’d<br>
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;<br>
Yet, that the world may witness that my end<br>
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,<br>
I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.<br>
In Syracusa was I born, and wed<br>
Unto a woman happy but for me,<br>
And by me, had not our hap been bad.<br>
With her I liv’d in joy; our wealth increas’d<br>
By prosperous voyages I often made<br>
To Epidamnum, till my factor’s death,<br>
And the great care of goods at random left,<br>
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;<br>
From whom my absence was not six months old<br>
Before herself (almost at fainting under<br>
The pleasing punishment that women bear)<br>
Had made provision for her following me,<br>
And soon and safe arrived where I was.<br>
There had she not been long but she became<br>
A joyful mother of two goodly sons,<br>
And, which was strange, the one so like the other<br>
As could not be distinguish’d but by names.<br>
That very hour, and in the self-same inn,<br>
A mean woman was delivered<br>
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.<br>
Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,<br>
I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.<br>
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,<br>
Made daily motions for our home return.<br>
Unwilling I agreed; alas, too soon<br>
We came aboard.<br>
A league from Epidamnum had we sail’d<br>
Before the always-wind-obeying deep<br>
Gave any tragic instance of our harm;<br>
But longer did we not retain much hope;<br>
For what obscured light the heavens did grant<br>
Did but convey unto our fearful minds<br>
A doubtful warrant of immediate death,<br>
Which though myself would gladly have embrac’d,<br>
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,<br>
Weeping before for what she saw must come,<br>
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,<br>
That mourn’d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,<br>
Forc’d me to seek delays for them and me.<br>
And this it was (for other means was none).<br>
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,<br>
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.<br>
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,<br>
Had fast’ned him unto a small spare mast,<br>
Such as sea-faring men provide for storms.<br>
To him one of the other twins was bound,<br>
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.<br>
The children thus dispos’d, my wife and I,<br>
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix’d,<br>
Fast’ned ourselves at either end the mast,<br>
And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,<br>
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.<br>
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,<br>
Dispers’d those vapours that offended us,<br>
And by the benefit of his wished light<br>
The seas wax’d calm, and we discovered<br>
Two ships from far, making amain to us,<br>
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.<br>
But ere they came—O, let me say no more!<br>
Gather the sequel by that went before.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE.<br>
Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so,<br>
For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
O, had the gods done so, I had not now<br>
Worthily term’d them merciless to us.<br>
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,<br>
We were encountered by a mighty rock,<br>
Which being violently borne upon,<br>
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;<br>
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,<br>
Fortune had left to both of us alike<br>
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.<br>
Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened<br>
With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,<br>
Was carried with more speed before the wind,<br>
And in our sight they three were taken up<br>
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.<br>
At length another ship had seiz’d on us;<br>
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,<br>
Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wrack’d guests,<br>
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,<br>
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;<br>
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.<br>
Thus have you heard me sever’d from my bliss,<br>
That by misfortunes was my life prolong’d<br>
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE.<br>
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,<br>
Do me the favour to dilate at full<br>
What have befall’n of them and thee till now.
</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,<br>
At eighteen years became inquisitive<br>
After his brother, and importun’d me<br>
That his attendant, so his case was like,<br>
Reft of his brother, but retain’d his name,<br>
Might bear him company in the quest of him;<br>
Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see,<br>
I hazarded the loss of whom I lov’d.<br>
Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,<br>
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,<br>
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus,<br>
Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought<br>
Or that or any place that harbours men.<br>
But here must end the story of my life;<br>
And happy were I in my timely death,<br>
Could all my travels warrant me they live.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE.<br>
Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have mark’d<br>
To bear the extremity of dire mishap;<br>
Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,<br>
Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,<br>
Which princes, would they, may not disannul,<br>
My soul should sue as advocate for thee.<br>
But though thou art adjudged to the death,<br>
And passed sentence may not be recall’d<br>
But to our honour’s great disparagement,<br>
Yet will I favour thee in what I can.<br>
Therefore, merchant, I’ll limit thee this day<br>
To seek thy health by beneficial help.<br>
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;<br>
Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,<br>
And live; if no, then thou art doom’d to die.<br>
Jailer, take him to thy custody.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JAILER.<br>
I will, my lord.
</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend,<br>
But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,<br>

This very day a Syracusian merchant<br>
Is apprehended for arrival here,<br>
And, not being able to buy out his life,<br>
According to the statute of the town<br>
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.<br>
There is your money that I had to keep.

Within this hour it will be dinnertime;<br>
Till that, I’ll view the manners of the town,<br>
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,<br>
And then return and sleep within mine inn,<br>
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.<br>
Get thee away.

Lightens my humour with his merry jests.<br>
What, will you walk with me about the town,<br>
And then go to my inn and dine with me?
</p>

MERCHANT.<br>
I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,<br>
Of whom I hope to make much benefit.<br>
I crave your pardon. Soon, at five o’clock,<br>

And afterward consort you till bedtime.<br>

Who, failing there to find his fellow forth,<br>

In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Return’d so soon? rather approach’d too late.<br>
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit;<br>
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;<br>
My mistress made it one upon my cheek.<br>
She is so hot because the meat is cold;<br>
The meat is cold because you come not home;<br>
You come not home because you have no stomach;<br>
You have no stomach, having broke your fast;<br>
But we that know what ’tis to fast and pray,<br>
Are penitent for your default today.

O, sixpence that I had o’ Wednesday last<br>
To pay the saddler for my mistress’ crupper:<br>
The saddler had it, sir, I kept it not.

<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
I am not in a sportive humour now.<br>
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?<br>
We being strangers here, how dar’st thou trust<br>

DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at dinner:<br>
I from my mistress come to you in post;<br>
If I return, I shall be post indeed,<br>

Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,<br>
And strike you home without a messenger.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season,<br>

My charge was but to fetch you from the mart<br>

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Now, as I am a Christian, answer me<br>

Perchance you will not bear them patiently.

Enter <span class="charname">Adriana</span>, wife to
Antipholus (of Ephesus) with <span class="charname">Luciana</span> her
sister.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
Neither my husband nor the slave return’d<br>
That in such haste I sent to seek his master?<br>
Sure, Luciana, it is two o’clock.
</p>
<p class="drama">
LUCIANA.<br>
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,<br>
And from the mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner.<br>
Good sister, let us dine, and never fret;<br>
A man is master of his liberty;<br>
Time is their master, and when they see time,<br>
They’ll go or come. If so, be patient, sister.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
Why should their liberty than ours be more?
</p>
<p class="drama">
LUCIANA.<br>
Because their business still lies out o’ door.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
</p>
<p class="drama">
LUCIANA.<br>
O, know he is the bridle of your will.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
There’s none but asses will be bridled so.
</p>
<p class="drama">
LUCIANA.<br>
Why, headstrong liberty is lash’d with woe.<br>
There’s nothing situate under heaven’s eye<br>
But hath his bound in earth, in sea, in sky.<br>
The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls<br>
Are their males’ subjects, and at their controls.<br>
Man, more divine, the masters of all these,<br>
Lord of the wide world and wild wat’ry seas,<br>
Indued with intellectual sense and souls,<br>
Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,<br>
Are masters to their females, and their lords:<br>
Then let your will attend on their accords.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
</p>
<p class="drama">
LUCIANA.<br>
Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
</p>
<p class="drama">
LUCIANA.<br>
Ere I learn love, I’ll practise to obey.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
How if your husband start some other where?
</p>
<p class="drama">
LUCIANA.<br>
Till he come home again, I would forbear.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
Patience unmov’d! No marvel though she pause;<br>
They can be meek that have no other cause.<br>
A wretched soul bruis’d with adversity,<br>
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;<br>
But were we burd’ned with like weight of pain,<br>
As much, or more, we should ourselves complain:<br>
So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,<br>
With urging helpless patience would relieve me:<br>
But if thou live to see like right bereft,<br>
This fool-begg’d patience in thee will be left.
</p>

Well, I will marry one day, but to try.<br>
Here comes your man, now is your husband nigh.

<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Nay, he’s at two hands with me, and that my two ears can witness.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
Say, didst thou speak with him? know’st thou his mind?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.<br>
Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
</p>
<p class="drama">
LUCIANA.<br>
Spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Nay, he struck so plainly I could too well feel his blows; and withal so
doubtfully that I could scarce understand them.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
But say, I prithee, is he coming home?<br>
It seems he hath great care to please his wife.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
Horn-mad, thou villain?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
I mean not cuckold-mad,<br>
But sure he’s stark mad.<br>
When I desir’d him to come home to dinner,<br>
He ask’d me for a thousand marks in gold.<br>
“’Tis dinner time,” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he.<br>
“Your meat doth burn” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he.<br>
“Will you come home?” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he.<br>
“Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?”<br>
“The pig” quoth I “is burn’d”. “My gold,” quoth he.<br>
“My mistress, sir,” quoth I. “Hang up thy mistress;<br>
I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!”
</p>
<p class="drama">
LUCIANA.<br>
Quoth who?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Quoth my master.<br>
“I know,” quoth he, “no house, no wife, no mistress.”<br>
So that my errand, due unto my tongue,<br>
I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;<br>
For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Go back again, and be new beaten home?<br>
For God’s sake, send some other messenger.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
Back slave, or I will break thy pate across.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
And he will bless that cross with other beating.<br>
Between you I shall have a holy head.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
Hence, prating peasant. Fetch thy master home.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Am I so round with you, as you with me,<br>
That like a football you do spurn me thus?<br>
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither.<br>

Fie, how impatience loureth in your face.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
His company must do his minions grace,<br>
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.<br>
Hath homely age th’ alluring beauty took<br>
From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it.<br>
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?<br>
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr’d,<br>
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.<br>
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?<br>
That’s not my fault; he’s master of my state.<br>
What ruins are in me that can be found<br>
By him not ruin’d? Then is he the ground<br>
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair<br>
A sunny look of his would soon repair;<br>
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale<br>
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
</p>
<p class="drama">
LUCIANA.<br>
Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.<br>
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,<br>
Or else what lets it but he would be here?<br>
Sister, you know he promis’d me a chain;<br>
Would that alone, a love he would detain,<br>
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed.<br>
I see the jewel best enamelled<br>
Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still<br>
That others touch, yet often touching will<br>
Wear gold; and no man that hath a name<br>
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.<br>
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,<br>
I’ll weep what’s left away, and weeping die.

My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,<br>

Hold, sir, for God’s sake, now your jest is earnest.<br>
Upon what bargain do you give it me?

<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Because that I familiarly sometimes<br>
Do use you for my fool, and chat with you,<br>
Your sauciness will jest upon my love,<br>

When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,<br>
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.<br>
If you will jest with me, know my aspect,<br>

Sconce, call you it? so you would leave battering, I had rather have it a head.
And you use these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and ensconce it

Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say, every why hath a wherefore.

Why, first, for flouting me; and then wherefore,<br>
For urging it the second time to me.

Well, sir, learn to jest in good time.<br>

By what rule, sir?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Let’s hear it.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
May he not do it by fine and recovery?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover the lost hair of another man.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful
an excrement?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he
hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
The plainer dealer, the sooner lost. Yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
For what reason?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
For two, and sound ones too.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Nay, not sound, I pray you.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>

<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Name them.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner
they should not drop in his porridge.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Marry, and did, sir; namely, e’en no time to recover hair lost by nature.

<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
But your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover.

will have bald followers.

Enter <span class="charname">Antipholus of
Ephesus</span>, his man <span class="charname">Dromio of Ephesus, Angelo</span>
the goldsmith and <span class="charname">Balthasar</span> the merchant.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all,<br>
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.<br>
Say that I linger’d with you at your shop<br>
To see the making of her carcanet,<br>
And that tomorrow you will bring it home.<br>
But here’s a villain that would face me down.<br>
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,<br>
And charg’d him with a thousand marks in gold,<br>
And that I did deny my wife and house.<br>
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.<br>
That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show;<br>
If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,<br>
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
I think thou art an ass.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Marry, so it doth appear<br>
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.<br>
I should kick, being kick’d; and being at that pass,<br>
You would keep from my heels, and beware of an ass.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
You’re sad, Signior Balthasar; pray God our cheer<br>
May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
</p>
<p class="drama">
BALTHASAR.<br>
I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
O, Signior Balthasar, either at flesh or fish<br>
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
</p>
<p class="drama">
BALTHASAR.<br>
Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
And welcome more common, for that’s nothing but words.
</p>
<p class="drama">
BALTHASAR<br>
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.<br>
But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;<br>
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.<br>
But soft; my door is lock’d. Go bid them let us in.

Either get thee from the door or sit down at the hatch:<br>
Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call’st for such store<br>
When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
What patch is made our porter? My master stays in the street.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Let him walk from whence he came, lest he catch cold on’s feet.
</p>

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
Who talks within there? Ho, open the door.
</p>

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Right, sir, I’ll tell you when an you’ll tell me wherefore.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
Wherefore? For my dinner. I have not dined today.
</p>

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Nor today here you must not; come again when you may.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
What art thou that keep’st me out from the house I owe?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
The porter for this time, sir, and my name is Dromio.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
O villain, thou hast stolen both mine office and my name;<br>
The one ne’er got me credit, the other mickle blame.<br>
If thou hadst been Dromio today in my place,<br>
Thou wouldst have chang’d thy face for a name, or thy name for an ass.

<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Let my master in, Luce.
</p>
<p class="drama">
LUCE.<br>
Faith, no, he comes too late,<br>
And so tell your master.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
O Lord, I must laugh;<br>
Have at you with a proverb:—Shall I set in my staff?
</p>

LUCE.<br>
Have at you with another: that’s—When? can you tell?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
If thy name be called Luce,—Luce, thou hast answer’d him well.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
Do you hear, you minion? you’ll let us in, I hope?
</p>
<p class="drama">
LUCE.<br>
I thought to have ask’d you.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
And you said no.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
So, come, help. Well struck, there was blow for blow.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
Thou baggage, let me in.
</p>
<p class="drama">
LUCE.<br>
Can you tell for whose sake?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Master, knock the door hard.
</p>
<p class="drama">
LUCE.<br>
Let him knock till it ache.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
You’ll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.
</p>
<p class="drama">
LUCE.<br>
What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?
</p>
<p class="scenedesc">
Enter <span class="charname">Adriana</span> concealed from
Antipholus of Ephesus and his companions.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
[<i>Within.</i>] Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
By my troth, your town is troubled with unruly boys.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
Are you there, wife? you might have come before.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
Your wife, sir knave? go, get you from the door.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
If you went in pain, master, this knave would go sore.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANGELO.<br>
Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome. We would fain have either.
</p>
<p class="drama">
BALTHASAR.<br>
In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.

<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.<br>
Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in the cold.<br>
It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
Go, fetch me something, I’ll break ope the gate.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Break any breaking here, and I’ll break your knave’s pate.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind;<br>
Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
It seems thou want’st breaking; out upon thee, hind!
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Here’s too much “out upon thee”; I pray thee, let me in.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
Well, I’ll break in; go, borrow me a crow.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
A crow without feather; master, mean you so?<br>
For a fish without a fin, there’s a fowl without a feather.<br>
If a crow help us in, sirrah, we’ll pluck a crow together.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
Go, get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
</p>
<p class="drama">
BALTHASAR.<br>
Have patience, sir. O, let it not be so:<br>
Herein you war against your reputation,<br>
And draw within the compass of suspect<br>
The unviolated honour of your wife.<br>
Once this,—your long experience of her wisdom,<br>
Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,<br>
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;<br>
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse<br>
Why at this time the doors are made against you.<br>
Be rul’d by me; depart in patience,<br>
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,<br>
And about evening, come yourself alone<br>
To know the reason of this strange restraint.<br>
If by strong hand you offer to break in<br>
Now in the stirring passage of the day,<br>
A vulgar comment will be made of it;<br>
And that supposed by the common rout<br>
Against your yet ungalled estimation<br>
That may with foul intrusion enter in,<br>
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;<br>
For slander lives upon succession,<br>
For ever hous’d where it gets possession.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
You have prevail’d. I will depart in quiet,<br>
And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.<br>
I know a wench of excellent discourse,<br>
Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle;<br>
There will we dine. This woman that I mean,<br>
My wife (but, I protest, without desert)<br>
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal;<br>
To her will we to dinner.—Get you home<br>
And fetch the chain, by this I know ’tis made.<br>
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine,<br>
For there’s the house. That chain will I bestow<br>
(Be it for nothing but to spite my wife)<br>
Upon mine hostess there. Good sir, make haste.<br>
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,<br>
I’ll knock elsewhere, to see if they’ll disdain me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANGELO.<br>
I’ll meet you at that place some hour hence.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense.

LUCIANA.<br>
And may it be that you have quite forgot<br>
A husband’s office? Shall, Antipholus,<br>
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?<br>
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?<br>
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,<br>
Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness;<br>
Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth,<br>
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness.<br>
Let not my sister read it in your eye;<br>
Be not thy tongue thy own shame’s orator;<br>
Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;<br>
Apparel vice like virtue’s harbinger;<br>
Bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted;<br>
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint,<br>
Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted?<br>
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?<br>
’Tis double wrong to truant with your bed<br>
And let her read it in thy looks at board.<br>
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;<br>
Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.<br>
Alas, poor women, make us but believe,<br>
Being compact of credit, that you love us.<br>
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;<br>
We in your motion turn, and you may move us.<br>
Then, gentle brother, get you in again;<br>
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife.<br>
’Tis holy sport to be a little vain<br>
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.

<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Sweet mistress, what your name is else, I know not,<br>
Nor by what wonder you do hit on mine;<br>
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not<br>
Than our earth’s wonder, more than earth divine.<br>
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;<br>
Lay open to my earthy gross conceit,<br>
Smother’d in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,<br>
The folded meaning of your words’ deceit.<br>
Against my soul’s pure truth why labour you<br>
To make it wander in an unknown field?<br>
Are you a god? would you create me new?<br>
Transform me, then, and to your power I’ll yield.<br>
But if that I am I, then well I know<br>
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,<br>
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe.<br>
Far more, far more, to you do I decline.<br>
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note<br>
To drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears.<br>
Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;<br>
Spread o’er the silver waves thy golden hairs,<br>
And as a bed I’ll take thee, and there lie,<br>
And, in that glorious supposition think<br>
He gains by death that hath such means to die.<br>
Let love, being light, be drowned if she sink!

Why, how now, Dromio? where runn’st thou so fast?

Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio? Am I your man? Am I myself?

Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
What woman’s man? and how besides thyself?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman, one that claims me, one that
haunts me, one that will have me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
What claim lays she to thee?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Marry, sir, such claim as you would lay to your horse, and she would have me as
a beast; not that I being a beast she would have me, but that she being a very
beastly creature lays claim to me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
What is she?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may not speak of
without he say “sir-reverence”. I have but lean luck in the match,
and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
How dost thou mean a “fat marriage”?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Marry, sir, she’s the kitchen wench, and all grease, and I know
not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run
from her by her own light. I warrant her rags and the tallow in
them will burn a Poland winter. If she lives till doomsday,
she’ll burn a week longer than the whole world.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
What complexion is she of?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Swart like my shoe, but her face nothing like so clean kept. For
why? she sweats, a man may go overshoes in the grime of it.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
That’s a fault that water will mend.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
No, sir, ’tis in grain; Noah’s flood could not do it.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
What’s her name?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that’s an ell and
three quarters, will not measure her from hip to hip.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Then she bears some breadth?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip. She is
spherical, like a globe. I could find out countries in her.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
In what part of her body stands Ireland?

<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
O, sir, upon her nose, all o’er-embellished with rubies,
carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot

ballast at her nose.

<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
O, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude: this drudge or
diviner laid claim to me, called me Dromio, swore I was assured
to her, told me what privy marks I had about me, as the mark of
my shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm,
that I, amazed, ran from her as a witch. And, I think, if my
breast had not been made of faith, and my heart of steel, she had
transformed me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i’ the wheel.

<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Go, hie thee presently, post to the road;<br>
And if the wind blow any way from shore,<br>

Could witness it, for he was with me then,<br>
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,<br>
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,<br>
Where Balthasar and I did dine together.<br>
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,<br>
I went to seek him. In the street I met him,<br>
And in his company that gentleman.<br>
There did this perjur’d goldsmith swear me down<br>
That I this day of him receiv’d the chain,<br>
Which, God he knows, I saw not. For the which<br>
He did arrest me with an officer.<br>
I did obey, and sent my peasant home<br>
For certain ducats. He with none return’d.<br>
Then fairly I bespoke the officer<br>
To go in person with me to my house.<br>
By th’ way we met<br>
My wife, her sister, and a rabble more<br>
Of vile confederates. Along with them<br>
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,<br>
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,<br>
A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller;<br>
A needy, hollow-ey’d, sharp-looking wretch;<br>
A living dead man. This pernicious slave,<br>
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,<br>
And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,<br>
And with no face (as ’twere) outfacing me,<br>
Cries out, I was possess’d. Then altogether<br>
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,<br>
And in a dark and dankish vault at home<br>
There left me and my man, both bound together,<br>
Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,<br>
I gain’d my freedom and immediately<br>
Ran hither to your Grace, whom I beseech<br>
To give me ample satisfaction<br>
For these deep shames and great indignities.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANGELO.<br>
My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,<br>
That he din’d not at home, but was lock’d out.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE.<br>
But had he such a chain of thee, or no?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANGELO.<br>
He had, my lord, and when he ran in here<br>
These people saw the chain about his neck.
</p>
<p class="drama">
MERCHANT.<br>
Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine<br>
Heard you confess you had the chain of him,<br>
After you first forswore it on the mart,<br>
And thereupon I drew my sword on you;<br>
And then you fled into this abbey here,<br>
From whence I think you are come by miracle.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
I never came within these abbey walls,<br>
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me.<br>
I never saw the chain, so help me heaven;<br>
And this is false you burden me withal.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE.<br>
Why, what an intricate impeach is this!<br>
I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup.<br>
If here you hous’d him, here he would have been.<br>
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.<br>
You say he din’d at home, the goldsmith here<br>
Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.
</p>
<p class="drama">
COURTESAN.<br>
He did, and from my finger snatch’d that ring.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
’Tis true, my liege, this ring I had of her.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE.<br>
Saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here?
</p>
<p class="drama">
COURTESAN.<br>
As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE.<br>
Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.<br>
I think you are all mated, or stark mad.
</p>
<p class="right">
[<i>Exit one to the Abbess.</i>]
</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word;<br>
Haply I see a friend will save my life<br>
And pay the sum that may deliver me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE.<br>
Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
Is not your name, sir, call’d Antipholus?<br>
And is not that your bondman Dromio?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,<br>
But he, I thank him, gnaw’d in two my cords.<br>
Now am I Dromio, and his man, unbound.
</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
I am sure you both of you remember me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you.<br>
For lately we were bound as you are now.<br>
You are not Pinch’s patient, are you, sir?
</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
Why look you strange on me? you know me well.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
I never saw you in my life till now.
</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
O! grief hath chang’d me since you saw me last,<br>
And careful hours with time’s deformed hand,<br>
Have written strange defeatures in my face.<br>
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
Neither.
</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
Dromio, nor thou?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
No, trust me, sir, nor I.
</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
I am sure thou dost.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not, and whatsoever a man denies, you
are now bound to believe him.
</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
Not know my voice! O time’s extremity,<br>
Hast thou so crack’d and splitted my poor tongue<br>
In seven short years that here my only son<br>
Knows not my feeble key of untun’d cares?<br>
Though now this grained face of mine be hid<br>
In sap-consuming winter’s drizzled snow,<br>
And all the conduits of my blood froze up,<br>
Yet hath my night of life some memory,<br>
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,<br>
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear.<br>
All these old witnesses, I cannot err,<br>
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
I never saw my father in my life.
</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,<br>
Thou know’st we parted; but perhaps, my son,<br>
Thou sham’st to acknowledge me in misery.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
The duke and all that know me in the city,<br>
Can witness with me that it is not so.<br>
I ne’er saw Syracusa in my life.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE.<br>
I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years<br>
Have I been patron to Antipholus,<br>
During which time he ne’er saw Syracusa.<br>
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc">
Enter the <span class="charname">Abbess</span> with
<span class="charname">Antipholus of Syracuse</span> and <span class="charname">Dromio

ABBESS.<br>
Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong’d.

[<i>All gather to see them.</i>]
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE.<br>
One of these men is <i>genius</i> to the other;<br>
And so of these, which is the natural man,<br>
And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
I, sir, am Dromio, command him away.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
I, sir, am Dromio, pray let me stay.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
Egeon, art thou not? or else his ghost?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br>
O, my old master, who hath bound him here?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ABBESS.<br>
Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,<br>
And gain a husband by his liberty.<br>
Speak, old Egeon, if thou be’st the man<br>
That hadst a wife once called Emilia,<br>
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons.<br>
O, if thou be’st the same Egeon, speak,<br>
And speak unto the same Emilia!
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE.<br>
Why, here begins his morning story right:<br>
These two Antipholus’, these two so like,<br>
And these two Dromios, one in semblance,<br>
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea.<br>
These are the parents to these children,<br>
Which accidentally are met together.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
EGEON.<br>
If I dream not, thou art Emilia.<br>
If thou art she, tell me where is that son<br>
That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ABBESS.<br>
By men of Epidamnum, he and I<br>
And the twin Dromio, all were taken up;<br>
But, by and by, rude fishermen of Corinth<br>
By force took Dromio and my son from them,<br>
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.<br>
What then became of them I cannot tell;<br>
I to this fortune that you see me in.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE.<br>
Antipholus, thou cam’st from Corinth first?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
No, sir, not I, I came from Syracuse.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE.<br>
Stay, stand apart, I know not which is which.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
And I with him.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>

Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.

ADRIANA.<br>
Which of you two did dine with me today?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
I, gentle mistress.

ADRIANA.<br>
And are not you my husband?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
No, I say nay to that.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
And so do I, yet did she call me so;<br>
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,<br>
Did call me brother. What I told you then,<br>
I hope I shall have leisure to make good,<br>
If this be not a dream I see and hear.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANGELO.<br>
That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
I think it be, sir. I deny it not.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANGELO.<br>
I think I did, sir. I deny it not.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADRIANA.<br>
I sent you money, sir, to be your bail<br>
By Dromio, but I think he brought it not.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br>
No, none by me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br>
This purse of ducats I receiv’d from you,<br>
And Dromio my man did bring them me.<br>
I see we still did meet each other’s man,<br>
And I was ta’en for him, and he for me,<br>
And thereupon these errors are arose.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
These ducats pawn I for my father here.

COURTESAN.<br>
Sir, I must have that diamond from you.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br>
There, take it, and much thanks for my good cheer.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ABBESS.<br>
Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains<br>
To go with us into the abbey here,<br>
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;<br>
And all that are assembled in this place,<br>
That by this sympathised one day’s error<br>
Have suffer’d wrong, go, keep us company,<br>
And we shall make full satisfaction.<br>
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail<br>
Of you, my sons, and till this present hour<br>
My heavy burden ne’er delivered.<br>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
