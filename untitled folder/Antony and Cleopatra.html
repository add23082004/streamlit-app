<p class="scenedesc">
Enter <span class="charname">Demetrius</span> and <span class="charname">Philo</span>.
</p>
<p class="drama">
PHILO.<br>
Nay, but this dotage of our general’s<br>
O’erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,<br>
That o’er the files and musters of the war<br>
Have glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn<br>
The office and devotion of their view<br>
Upon a tawny front. His captain’s heart,<br>
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst<br>
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper<br>
And is become the bellows and the fan<br>
To cool a gipsy’s lust.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc">
Flourish. Enter <span class="charname">Antony</span> and <span class="charname">Cleopatra,</span> her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning
her.
</p>
<p class="drama">
Look where they come:<br>
Take but good note, and you shall see in him<br>
The triple pillar of the world transform’d<br>
Into a strumpet’s fool. Behold and see.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
There’s beggary in the love that can be reckoned.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
I’ll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc">
Enter a <span class="charname">Messenger</span>.
</p>
<p class="drama">
MESSENGER.<br>
News, my good lord, from Rome.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
Grates me, the sum.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
Nay, hear them, Antony.<br>
Fulvia perchance is angry; or who knows<br>
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent<br>
His powerful mandate to you: “Do this or this;<br>
Take in that kingdom and enfranchise that.<br>
Perform’t, or else we damn thee.”
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
How, my love?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
Perchance! Nay, and most like.<br>
You must not stay here longer; your dismission<br>
Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.<br>
Where’s Fulvia’s process?—Caesar’s I would say? Both?<br>
Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt’s queen,<br>
Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine<br>
Is Caesar’s homager; else so thy cheek pays shame<br>
When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch<br>
Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.<br>
Kingdoms are clay. Our dungy earth alike<br>
Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life<br>
Is to do thus [<i>Embracing</i>]; when such a mutual pair<br>
And such a twain can do’t, in which I bind,<br>
On pain of punishment, the world to weet<br>
We stand up peerless.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
Excellent falsehood!<br>
Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?<br>
I’ll seem the fool I am not. Antony<br>
Will be himself.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
But stirred by Cleopatra.<br>
Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,<br>
Let’s not confound the time with conference harsh.<br>
There’s not a minute of our lives should stretch<br>
Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
Hear the ambassadors.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
Fie, wrangling queen!<br>
Whom everything becomes—to chide, to laugh,<br>
To weep; whose every passion fully strives<br>
To make itself, in thee fair and admired!<br>
No messenger but thine, and all alone<br>
Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and note<br>
The qualities of people. Come, my queen,<br>
Last night you did desire it. Speak not to us.
</p>
<p class="right">
[<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Antony</span> and <span class="charname">Cleopatra</span> with the Train.</i>]
</p>
<p class="drama">
DEMETRIUS.<br>
Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?
</p>
<p class="drama">
PHILO.<br>
Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony,<br>
He comes too short of that great property<br>
Which still should go with Antony.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DEMETRIUS.<br>
I am full sorry<br>
That he approves the common liar who<br>
Thus speaks of him at Rome, but I will hope<br>
Of better deeds tomorrow. Rest you happy!

<p class="drama">
CHARMIAN.<br>
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas,
where’s the soothsayer that you praised so to th’ queen? O, that I knew this
husband which you say must charge his horns with garlands!
</p>
<p class="drama">
ALEXAS.<br>
Soothsayer!
</p>
<p class="drama">
SOOTHSAYER.<br>
Your will?

CHARMIAN.<br>
Is this the man? Is’t you, sir, that know things?

SOOTHSAYER.<br>
In nature’s infinite book of secrecy<br>
A little I can read.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ALEXAS.<br>
Show him your hand.

<p class="drama">
ENOBARBUS.<br>
Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough<br>
Cleopatra’s health to drink.

CHARMIAN.<br>
Good, sir, give me good fortune.
</p>
<p class="drama">
SOOTHSAYER.<br>
I make not, but foresee.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARMIAN.<br>
Pray, then, foresee me one.

SOOTHSAYER.<br>
You shall be yet far fairer than you are.

CHARMIAN.<br>
He means in flesh.

<p class="drama">
IRAS.<br>
No, you shall paint when you are old.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARMIAN.<br>
Wrinkles forbid!

<p class="drama">
ALEXAS.<br>
Vex not his prescience. Be attentive.

<p class="drama">
CHARMIAN.<br>
Hush!

<p class="drama">
SOOTHSAYER.<br>
You shall be more beloving than beloved.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARMIAN.<br>
I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ALEXAS.<br>
Nay, hear him.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARMIAN.<br>
Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to three kings in a
forenoon and widow them all. Let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of
Jewry may do homage. Find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me
with my mistress.
</p>
<p class="drama">
SOOTHSAYER.<br>
You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARMIAN.<br>
O, excellent! I love long life better than figs.
</p>
<p class="drama">
SOOTHSAYER.<br>
You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune<br>
Than that which is to approach.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARMIAN.<br>
Then belike my children shall have no names. Prithee, how many boys and wenches
must I have?

<p class="drama">
SOOTHSAYER.<br>
If every of your wishes had a womb,<br>
And fertile every wish, a million.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARMIAN.<br>
Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ALEXAS.<br>
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARMIAN.<br>
Nay, come, tell Iras hers.

<p class="drama">
ALEXAS.<br>
We’ll know all our fortunes.

Mine, and most of our fortunes tonight, shall be drunk to bed.

Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity to cast them away for

Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their deities to
take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;
comforting therein that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make
new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the
case to be lamented. This grief is crowned with consolation; your old smock
brings forth a new petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion that should
water this sorrow.

Madam, I trust not so.

Thou, eunuch Mardian!
</p>
<p class="drama">
MARDIAN.<br>
What’s your highness’ pleasure?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
Not now to hear thee sing. I take no pleasure<br>
In aught an eunuch has. ’Tis well for thee<br>
That, being unseminared, thy freer thoughts<br>
May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
</p>
<p class="drama">
MARDIAN.<br>
Yes, gracious madam.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
Indeed?
</p>
<p class="drama">
MARDIAN.<br>
Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing<br>
But what indeed is honest to be done.<br>
Yet have I fierce affections, and think<br>
What Venus did with Mars.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
O, Charmian,<br>
Where think’st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?<br>
Or does he walk? Or is he on his horse?<br>
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!<br>
Do bravely, horse, for wot’st thou whom thou mov’st?<br>
The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm<br>
And burgonet of men. He’s speaking now,<br>
Or murmuring “Where’s my serpent of old Nile?”<br>
For so he calls me. Now I feed myself<br>
With most delicious poison. Think on me<br>
That am with Phœbus’ amorous pinches black,<br>
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,<br>
When thou wast here above the ground, I was<br>
A morsel for a monarch. And great Pompey<br>
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;<br>
There would he anchor his aspect, and die<br>
With looking on his life.

ALEXAS.<br>
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!

How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!<br>
Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath<br>
With his tinct gilded thee.<br>
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ALEXAS.<br>
Last thing he did, dear queen,<br>
He kissed—the last of many doubled kisses—<br>
This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
Mine ear must pluck it thence.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ALEXAS.<br>
“Good friend,” quoth he,<br>
“Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends<br>
This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,<br>
To mend the petty present, I will piece<br>
Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the east,<br>
Say thou, shall call her mistress.” So he nodded<br>
And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,<br>
Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke<br>
Was beastly dumbed by him.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
What, was he sad or merry?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ALEXAS.<br>
Like to the time o’ th’ year between the extremes<br>
Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
O well-divided disposition!—Note him,<br>
Note him, good Charmian, ’tis the man; but note him:<br>
He was not sad, for he would shine on those<br>
That make their looks by his; he was not merry,<br>
Which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay<br>
In Egypt with his joy; but between both.<br>
O heavenly mingle!—Be’st thou sad or merry,<br>
The violence of either thee becomes,<br>
So does it no man else.—Met’st thou my posts?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ALEXAS.<br>
Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.<br>
Why do you send so thick?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
Who’s born that day<br>
When I forget to send to Antony<br>
Shall die a beggar.—Ink and paper, Charmian.—<br>
Welcome, my good Alexas.—Did I, Charmian,<br>
Ever love Caesar so?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARMIAN.<br>
O that brave Caesar!
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
Be choked with such another emphasis!<br>
Say “the brave Antony.”
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARMIAN.<br>
The valiant Caesar!
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth<br>
If thou with Caesar paragon again<br>
My man of men.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARMIAN.<br>
By your most gracious pardon,<br>
I sing but after you.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
My salad days,<br>
When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,<br>
To say as I said then. But come, away,<br>
Get me ink and paper.<br>

Or I’ll unpeople Egypt.

I shall do well.<br>
The people love me, and the sea is mine;<br>
My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope<br>
Says it will come to th’ full. Mark Antony<br>
In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make<br>
No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where<br>
He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,<br>
Of both is flattered; but he neither loves<br>
Nor either cares for him.

I could have given less matter<br>

CAESAR.<br>
I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.

LEPIDUS.<br>
Noble friends,<br>
That which combined us was most great, and let not<br>
A leaner action rend us. What’s amiss,<br>

Nor curstness grow to th’ matter.
</p>
<p class="drama">

I should do thus.

Thank you.

<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
I learn you take things ill which are not so,<br>

<p class="drama">
CAESAR.<br>
I must be laughed at<br>
If, or for nothing or a little, I<br>
Should say myself offended, and with you<br>
Chiefly i’ th’ world; more laughed at that I should<br>
Once name you derogately when to sound your name<br>
It not concerned me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
My being in Egypt, Caesar,<br>
What was’t to you?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CAESAR.<br>
No more than my residing here at Rome<br>
Might be to you in Egypt. Yet if you there<br>
Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt<br>
Might be my question.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
How intend you, practised?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CAESAR.<br>
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent<br>
By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother<br>
Made wars upon me, and their contestation<br>
Was theme for you; you were the word of war.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
You do mistake your business. My brother never<br>
Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,<br>
And have my learning from some true reports<br>
That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather<br>
Discredit my authority with yours,<br>
And make the wars alike against my stomach,<br>
Having alike your cause? Of this my letters<br>
Before did satisfy you. If you’ll patch a quarrel,<br>
As matter whole you have not to make it with,<br>
It must not be with this.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CAESAR.<br>
You praise yourself<br>
By laying defects of judgment to me; but<br>
You patched up your excuses.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
Not so, not so.<br>
I know you could not lack—I am certain on’t—<br>
Very necessity of this thought, that I,<br>
Your partner in the cause ’gainst which he fought,<br>
Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars<br>
Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,<br>
I would you had her spirit in such another.<br>
The third o’ th’ world is yours, which with a snaffle<br>
You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ENOBARBUS.<br>
Would we had all such wives, that the men<br>
Might go to wars with the women.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,<br>
Made out of her impatience—which not wanted<br>
Shrewdness of policy too—I grieving grant<br>
Did you too much disquiet. For that you must<br>
But say I could not help it.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CAESAR.<br>
I wrote to you<br>
When rioting in Alexandria; you<br>
Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts<br>
Did gibe my missive out of audience.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
Sir,<br>
He fell upon me ere admitted, then.<br>
Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want<br>
Of what I was i’ th’ morning. But next day<br>
I told him of myself, which was as much<br>
As to have asked him pardon. Let this fellow<br>
Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,<br>
Out of our question wipe him.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CAESAR.<br>
You have broken<br>
The article of your oath, which you shall never<br>
Have tongue to charge me with.
</p>
<p class="drama">
LEPIDUS.<br>
Soft, Caesar!
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
No, Lepidus, let him speak.<br>
The honour is sacred which he talks on now,<br>
Supposing that I lacked it. But on, Caesar:<br>
The article of my oath?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CAESAR.<br>
To lend me arms and aid when I required them,<br>
The which you both denied.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
Neglected, rather;<br>
And then when poisoned hours had bound me up<br>
From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may<br>
I’ll play the penitent to you. But mine honesty<br>
Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power<br>
Work without it. Truth is that Fulvia,<br>
To have me out of Egypt, made wars here,<br>
For which myself, the ignorant motive, do<br>
So far ask pardon as befits mine honour<br>
To stoop in such a case.
</p>
<p class="drama">
LEPIDUS.<br>
’Tis noble spoken.
</p>
<p class="drama">
MAECENAS.<br>
If it might please you to enforce no further<br>
The griefs between ye; to forget them quite<br>
Were to remember that the present need<br>
Speaks to atone you.
</p>
<p class="drama">
LEPIDUS.<br>
Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ENOBARBUS.<br>
Or, if you borrow one another’s love for the instant, you may, when you hear no
more words of Pompey, return it again. You shall have time to wrangle in when
you have nothing else to do.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ENOBARBUS.<br>
That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.

ANTONY.<br>
You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ENOBARBUS.<br>
Go to, then. Your considerate stone!
</p>
<p class="drama">
CAESAR.<br>
I do not much dislike the matter, but<br>
The manner of his speech; for’t cannot be<br>
We shall remain in friendship, our conditions<br>
So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew<br>
What hoop should hold us staunch, from edge to edge<br>
O’ th’ world I would pursue it.

AGRIPPA.<br>
Give me leave, Caesar.

<p class="drama">
CAESAR.<br>
Speak, Agrippa.

<p class="drama">
AGRIPPA.<br>
Thou hast a sister by the mother’s side,<br>
Admired Octavia. Great Mark Antony<br>
Is now a widower.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CAESAR.<br>
Say not so, Agrippa.<br>
If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof<br>
Were well deserved of rashness.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear<br>
Agrippa further speak.

<p class="drama">
AGRIPPA.<br>
To hold you in perpetual amity,<br>
To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts<br>
With an unslipping knot, take Antony<br>
Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims<br>
No worse a husband than the best of men;<br>
Whose virtue and whose general graces speak<br>
That which none else can utter. By this marriage<br>
All little jealousies, which now seem great,<br>
And all great fears, which now import their dangers,<br>
Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,<br>
Where now half-tales be truths. Her love to both<br>
Would each to other, and all loves to both,<br>
Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,<br>
For ’tis a studied, not a present thought,<br>
By duty ruminated.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
Will Caesar speak?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CAESAR.<br>
Not till he hears how Antony is touched<br>
With what is spoke already.

<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
What power is in Agrippa,<br>
If I would say “Agrippa, be it so,”<br>
To make this good?

CAESAR.<br>
The power of Caesar, and<br>
His power unto Octavia.

May I never<br>
To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,<br>
Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand.<br>
Further this act of grace; and from this hour<br>
The heart of brothers govern in our loves<br>
And sway our great designs!
</p>
<p class="drama">
CAESAR.<br>
There’s my hand.<br>
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother<br>
Did ever love so dearly. Let her live<br>
To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never<br>
Fly off our loves again!
</p>
<p class="drama">
LEPIDUS.<br>
Happily, amen!
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTONY.<br>
I did not think to draw my sword ’gainst Pompey,<br>
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great<br>
Of late upon me. I must thank him only,<br>
Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;<br>
At heel of that, defy him.

Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we<br>
The business we have talked of.

<p class="drama">
ENOBARBUS.<br>
I will tell you.<br>
The barge she sat in, like a burnished throne,<br>
Burned on the water. The poop was beaten gold;<br>
Purple the sails, and so perfumed that<br>
The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,<br>
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made<br>
The water which they beat to follow faster,<br>
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,<br>
It beggared all description: she did lie<br>
In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold of tissue,<br>
O’erpicturing that Venus where we see<br>
The fancy outwork nature. On each side her<br>
Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,<br>
With divers-coloured fans, whose wind did seem<br>
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,<br>
And what they undid did.

Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,<br>

And made their bends adornings. At the helm<br>
A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle<br>
Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands<br>
That yarely frame the office. From the barge<br>
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense<br>
Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast<br>
Her people out upon her, and Antony,<br>
Enthroned i’ th’ market-place, did sit alone,<br>
Whistling to th’ air, which, but for vacancy,<br>
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,<br>
And made a gap in nature.

Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,<br>
Invited her to supper. She replied<br>
It should be better he became her guest,<br>
Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,<br>
Whom ne’er the word of “No” woman heard speak,<br>
Being barbered ten times o’er, goes to the feast,<br>
And, for his ordinary, pays his heart<br>
For what his eyes eat only.

Hop forty paces through the public street<br>

</p>
<p class="drama">
ENOBARBUS.<br>
Caesar’s sister is called Octavia.
</p>
<p class="drama">
MENAS.<br>
True, sir. She was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ENOBARBUS.<br>
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
</p>
<p class="drama">
MENAS.<br>
Pray you, sir?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ENOBARBUS.<br>
’Tis true.
</p>
<p class="drama">
MENAS.<br>
Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ENOBARBUS.<br>
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.
</p>
<p class="drama">
MENAS.<br>
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of
the parties.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ENOBARBUS.<br>
I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship
together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold,
and still conversation.
</p>
<p class="drama">
MENAS.<br>
Who would not have his wife so?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ENOBARBUS.<br>
Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian
dish again. Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as
I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the
immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is.
He married but his occasion here.
</p>
<p class="drama">
MENAS.<br>
And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ENOBARBUS.<br>
I shall take it, sir. We have used our throats in Egypt.
</p>

Come, let’s away.

Were publicly enthroned. At the feet sat<br>
Caesarion, whom they call my father’s son,<br>

CLOWN.<br>
You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
Ay, ay, farewell.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLOWN.<br>
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people; for
indeed there is no goodness in the worm.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLOWN.<br>
Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth the feeding.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
Will it eat me?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLOWN.<br>
You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a
woman. I know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her not.
But truly, these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women,
for in every ten that they make, the devils mar five.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
Well, get thee gone. Farewell.

CLOWN.<br>
Yes, forsooth. I wish you joy o’ th’ worm.

<p class="drama">
CLEOPATRA.<br>
Give me my robe. Put on my crown. I have<br>
Immortal longings in me. Now no more<br>
The juice of Egypt’s grape shall moist this lip.<br>
Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear<br>
Antony call. I see him rouse himself<br>
To praise my noble act. I hear him mock<br>
The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men<br>
To excuse their after wrath. Husband, I come!<br>
Now to that name my courage prove my title!<br>
I am fire and air; my other elements<br>
I give to baser life.—So, have you done?<br>
Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.<br>
Farewell, kind Charmian. Iras, long farewell.

Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?<br>
If thou and nature can so gently part,<br>
The stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch,<br>

It is not worth leave-taking.

If she first meet the curled Antony,<br>
He’ll make demand of her, and spend that kiss<br>

[<i>To an asp, which she applies to her breast.</i>]

With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate<br>

DOLABELLA.<br>
O sir, you are too sure an augurer:<br>
That you did fear is done.

CAESAR.<br>
Bravest at the last,<br>
She levelled at our purposes and, being royal,<br>

I do not see them bleed.

<p class="drama">
DOLABELLA.<br>
Who was last with them?
</p>
<p class="drama">
FIRST GUARD.<br>
A simple countryman that brought her figs.<br>
This was his basket.

CAESAR.<br>
Poisoned then.

<p class="drama">
FIRST GUARD.<br>
O Caesar,<br>
This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake.<br>
I found her trimming up the diadem<br>
On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood,<br>
And on the sudden dropped.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CAESAR.<br>
O noble weakness!<br>
If they had swallowed poison ’twould appear<br>

As she would catch another Antony<br>
In her strong toil of grace.

Here on her breast<br>
There is a vent of blood, and something blown.<br>
The like is on her arm.

This is an aspic’s trail, and these fig leaves<br>
Have slime upon them, such as th’ aspic leaves<br>
Upon the caves of Nile.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CAESAR.<br>
Most probable<br>
That so she died, for her physician tells me<br>
She hath pursued conclusions infinite<br>
Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,<br>
And bear her women from the monument.<br>
She shall be buried by her Antony.<br>
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it<br>
A pair so famous. High events as these<br>
Strike those that make them; and their story is<br>
No less in pity than his glory which<br>
Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall<br>
In solemn show attend this funeral,<br>
And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see<br>
High order in this great solemnity.

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO

remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
