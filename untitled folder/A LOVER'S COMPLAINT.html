<p id="id00001" style="margin-top: 4em">by William Shakespeare</p>

<p id="id00002" style="margin-top: 4em">  From off a hill whose concave womb reworded<br>

  A plaintful story from a sist'ring vale,<br>

  My spirits t'attend this double voice accorded,<br>

  And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale,<br>

  Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,<br>

  Tearing of papers, breaking rings atwain,<br>

  Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00003">  Upon her head a platted hive of straw,<br>

  Which fortified her visage from the sun,<br>

  Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw<br>

  The carcase of a beauty spent and done.<br>

  Time had not scythed all that youth begun,<br>

  Nor youth all quit, but spite of heaven's fell rage<br>

  Some beauty peeped through lattice of seared age.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00004">  Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,<br>

  Which on it had conceited characters,<br>

  Laund'ring the silken figures in the brine<br>

  That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears,<br>

  And often reading what contents it bears;<br>

  As often shrieking undistinguished woe,<br>

  In clamours of all size, both high and low.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00005">  Sometimes her levelled eyes their carriage ride,<br>

  As they did batt'ry to the spheres intend;<br>

  Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied<br>

  To th' orbed earth; sometimes they do extend<br>

  Their view right on; anon their gazes lend<br>

  To every place at once, and nowhere fixed,<br>

  The mind and sight distractedly commixed.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00006">  Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,<br>

  Proclaimed in her a careless hand of pride;<br>

  For some, untucked, descended her sheaved hat,<br>

  Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;<br>

  Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,<br>

  And, true to bondage, would not break from thence,<br>

  Though slackly braided in loose negligence.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00007">  A thousand favours from a maund she drew<br>

  Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,<br>

  Which one by one she in a river threw,<br>

  Upon whose weeping margent she was set;<br>

  Like usury applying wet to wet,<br>

  Or monarchs' hands that lets not bounty fall<br>

  Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00008">  Of folded schedules had she many a one,<br>

  Which she perused, sighed, tore, and gave the flood;<br>

  Cracked many a ring of posied gold and bone,<br>

  Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;<br>

  Found yet moe letters sadly penned in blood,<br>

  With sleided silk feat and affectedly<br>

  Enswathed and sealed to curious secrecy.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00009">  These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,<br>

  And often kissed, and often 'gan to tear;<br>

  Cried, 'O false blood, thou register of lies,<br>

  What unapproved witness dost thou bear!<br>

  Ink would have seemed more black and damned here!<br>

  This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,<br>

  Big discontents so breaking their contents.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00010">  A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,<br>

  Sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew<br>

  Of court, of city, and had let go by<br>

  The swiftest hours observed as they flew,<br>

  Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew;<br>

  And, privileged by age, desires to know<br>

  In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00011">  So slides he down upon his grained bat,<br>

  And comely distant sits he by her side;<br>

  When he again desires her, being sat,<br>

  Her grievance with his hearing to divide.<br>

  If that from him there may be aught applied<br>

  Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,<br>

  'Tis promised in the charity of age.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00012">  'Father,' she says, 'though in me you behold<br>

  The injury of many a blasting hour,<br>

  Let it not tell your judgement I am old:<br>

  Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power.<br>

  I might as yet have been a spreading flower,<br>

  Fresh to myself, if I had self-applied<br>

  Love to myself, and to no love beside.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00013">  'But woe is me! too early I attended<br>

  A youthful suit- it was to gain my grace-<br>

  O, one by nature's outwards so commended<br>

  That maidens' eyes stuck over all his face.<br>

  Love lacked a dwelling and made him her place;<br>

  And when in his fair parts she did abide,<br>

  She was new lodged and newly deified.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00014">  'His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;<br>

  And every light occasion of the wind<br>

  Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.<br>

  What's sweet to do, to do will aptly find:<br>

  Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind;<br>

  For on his visage was in little drawn<br>

  What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00015">  'Small show of man was yet upon his chin;<br>

  His phoenix down began but to appear,<br>

  Like unshorn velvet, on that termless skin,<br>

  Whose bare out-bragged the web it seemed to wear:<br>

  Yet showed his visage by that cost more dear;<br>

  And nice affections wavering stood in doubt<br>

  If best were as it was, or best without.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00016">  'His qualities were beauteous as his form,<br>

  For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;<br>

  Yet if men moved him, was he such a storm<br>

  As oft 'twixt May and April is to see,<br>

  When winds breathe sweet, unruly though they be.<br>

  His rudeness so with his authorized youth<br>

  Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00017">  'Well could he ride, and often men would say,<br>

  "That horse his mettle from his rider takes:<br>

  Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,<br>

  What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!"<br>

  And controversy hence a question takes<br>

  Whether the horse by him became his deed,<br>

  Or he his manage by th' well-doing steed.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00018">  'But quickly on this side the verdict went:<br>

  His real habitude gave life and grace<br>

  To appertainings and to ornament,<br>

  Accomplished in himself, not in his case,<br>

  All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,<br>

  Came for additions; yet their purposed trim<br>

  Pierced not his grace, but were all graced by him.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00019">  'So on the tip of his subduing tongue<br>

  All kind of arguments and question deep,<br>

  All replication prompt, and reason strong,<br>

  For his advantage still did wake and sleep.<br>

  To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,<br>

  He had the dialect and different skill,<br>

  Catching all passions in his craft of will,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00020">  'That he did in the general bosom reign<br>

  Of young, of old, and sexes both enchanted,<br>

  To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain<br>

  In personal duty, following where he haunted.<br>

  Consents bewitched, ere he desire, have granted,<br>

  And dialogued for him what he would say,<br>

  Asked their own wills, and made their wills obey.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00021">  'Many there were that did his picture get,<br>

  To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;<br>

  Like fools that in th' imagination set<br>

  The goodly objects which abroad they find<br>

  Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assigned;<br>

  And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them<br>

  Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00022">  'So many have, that never touched his hand,<br>

  Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.<br>

  My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,<br>

  And was my own fee-simple, not in part,<br>

  What with his art in youth, and youth in art,<br>

  Threw my affections in his charmed power<br>

  Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00023">  'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,<br>

  Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;<br>

  Finding myself in honour so forbid,<br>

  With safest distance I mine honour shielded.<br>

  Experience for me many bulwarks builded<br>

  Of proofs new-bleeding, which remained the foil<br>

  Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00024">  'But ah, who ever shunned by precedent<br>

  The destined ill she must herself assay?<br>

  Or forced examples, 'gainst her own content,<br>

  To put the by-past perils in her way?<br>

  Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay;<br>

  For when we rage, advice is often seen<br>

  By blunting us to make our wills more keen.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00025">  'Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood<br>

  That we must curb it upon others' proof,<br>

  To be forbod the sweets that seems so good<br>

  For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.<br>

  O appetite, from judgement stand aloof!<br>

  The one a palate hath that needs will taste,<br>

  Though Reason weep, and cry it is thy last.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00026">  'For further I could say this man's untrue,<br>

  And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;<br>

  Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew;<br>

  Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;<br>

  Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;<br>

  Thought characters and words merely but art,<br>

  And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00027">  'And long upon these terms I held my city,<br>

  Till thus he 'gan besiege me: "Gentle maid,<br>

  Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,<br>

  And be not of my holy vows afraid.<br>

  That's to ye sworn to none was ever said;<br>

  For feasts of love I have been called unto,<br>

  Till now did ne'er invite nor never woo.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00028">  '"All my offences that abroad you see<br>

  Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;<br>

  Love made them not; with acture they may be,<br>

  Where neither party is nor true nor kind.<br>

  They sought their shame that so their shame did find;<br>

  And so much less of shame in me remains<br>

  By how much of me their reproach contains.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00029">  '"Among the many that mine eyes have seen,<br>

  Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed,<br>

  Or my affection put to th' smallest teen,<br>

  Or any of my leisures ever charmed.<br>

  Harm have I done to them, but ne'er was harmed;<br>

  Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,<br>

  And reigned commanding in his monarchy.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00030">  '"Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me,<br>

  Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood;<br>

  Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me<br>

  Of grief and blushes, aptly understood<br>

  In bloodless white and the encrimsoned mood-<br>

  Effects of terror and dear modesty,<br>

  Encamped in hearts, but fighting outwardly.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00031">  '"And, lo, behold these talents of their hair,<br>

  With twisted metal amorously empleached,<br>

  I have receiv'd from many a several fair,<br>

  Their kind acceptance weepingly beseeched,<br>

  With the annexions of fair gems enriched,<br>

  And deep-brained sonnets that did amplify<br>

  Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00032">  '"The diamond? why, 'twas beautiful and hard,<br>

  Whereto his invised properties did tend;<br>

  The deep-green em'rald, in whose fresh regard<br>

  Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;<br>

  The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend<br>

  With objects manifold; each several stone,<br>

  With wit well blazoned, smiled, or made some moan.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00033">  '"Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,<br>

  Of pensived and subdued desires the tender,<br>

  Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not,<br>

  But yield them up where I myself must render-<br>

  That is, to you, my origin and ender;<br>

  For these, of force, must your oblations be,<br>

  Since I their altar, you enpatron me.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00034">  '"O then advance of yours that phraseless hand<br>

  Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;<br>

  Take all these similes to your own command,<br>

  Hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise;<br>

  What me your minister for you obeys<br>

  Works under you; and to your audit comes<br>

  Their distract parcels in combined sums.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00035">  '"Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,<br>

  Or sister sanctified, of holiest note,<br>

  Which late her noble suit in court did shun,<br>

  Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;<br>

  For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,<br>

  But kept cold distance, and did thence remove<br>

  To spend her living in eternal love.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00036">  '"But, O my sweet, what labour is't to leave<br>

  The thing we have not, mast'ring what not strives,<br>

  Playing the place which did no form receive,<br>

  Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves!<br>

  She that her fame so to herself contrives,<br>

  The accident which brought me to her eye<br>

  Upon the moment did her force subdue,<br>

  And now she would the caged cloister fly.<br>

  Religious love put out religion's eye.<br>

  Not to be tempted, would she be immured,<br>

  And mine I pour your ocean all among.<br>

  I strong o'er them, and you o'er me being strong,<br>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work

phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>

    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
