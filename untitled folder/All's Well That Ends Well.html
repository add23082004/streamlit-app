<p id="id00015">We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]

which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.</p>

Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace</h4>

<p id="id00055">Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON, HELENA, and LAFEU, all
in black</p>

<p id="id00056">  COUNTESS. In delivering my son from me, I bury a second<br>

husband.<br>

  BERTRAM. And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death<br>

anew;<br>

    but I must attend his Majesty's command, to whom I am now in<br>

    ward, evermore in subjection.<br>

  LAFEU. You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a<br>

    father. He that so generally is at all times good must of<br>

    necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir<br>

it<br>

    up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such<br>

    abundance.<br>

  COUNTESS. What hope is there of his Majesty's amendment?<br>

  LAFEU. He hath abandon'd his physicians, madam; under whose<br>

    practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no<br>

other<br>

    advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.<br>

  COUNTESS. This young gentlewoman had a father- O, that 'had,'<br>

how<br>

    sad a passage 'tis!-whose skill was almost as great as his<br>

    honesty; had it stretch'd so far, would have made nature<br>

    immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would,<br>

for<br>

    the King's sake, he were living! I think it would be the<br>

death of<br>

    the King's disease.<br>

  LAFEU. How call'd you the man you speak of, madam?<br>

  COUNTESS. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his<br>

    great right to be so- Gerard de Narbon.<br>

  LAFEU. He was excellent indeed, madam; the King very lately<br>

spoke<br>

    of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to<br>

have<br>

    liv'd still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.<br>

  BERTRAM. What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?<br>

  LAFEU. A fistula, my lord.<br>

  BERTRAM. I heard not of it before.<br>

  LAFEU. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the<br>

    daughter of Gerard de Narbon?<br>

  COUNTESS. His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my<br>

    overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her<br>

education<br>

    promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair<br>

gifts<br>

    fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities,<br>

    there commendations go with pity-they are virtues and<br>

traitors<br>

    too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she<br>

derives<br>

    her honesty, and achieves her goodness.<br>

  LAFEU. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.<br>

  COUNTESS. 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise<br>

in.<br>

    The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but<br>

the<br>

    tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek.<br>

No<br>

    more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather<br>

thought<br>

    you affect a sorrow than to have-<br>

  HELENA. I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.<br>

  LAFEU. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead: excessive<br>

    grief the enemy to the living.<br>

  COUNTESS. If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes<br>

it<br>

    soon mortal.<br>

  BERTRAM. Madam, I desire your holy wishes.<br>

  LAFEU. How understand we that?<br>

  COUNTESS. Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father<br>

    In manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue<br>

    Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness<br>

    Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,<br>

    Do wrong to none; be able for thine enemy<br>

    Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend<br>

    Under thy own life's key; be check'd for silence,<br>

    But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,<br>

    That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,<br>

    Fall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,<br>

    'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,<br>

    Advise him.<br>

  LAFEU. He cannot want the best<br>

    That shall attend his love.<br>

  COUNTESS. Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.            Exit<br>

  BERTRAM. The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoughts be<br>

    servants to you!  [To HELENA]  Be comfortable to my mother,<br>

your<br>

    mistress, and make much of her.<br>

  LAFEU. Farewell, pretty lady; you must hold the credit of your<br>

    father.                             Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU<br>

  HELENA. O, were that all! I think not on my father;<br>

    And these great tears grace his remembrance more<br>

    Than those I shed for him. What was he like?<br>

    I have forgot him; my imagination<br>

    Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.<br>

    I am undone; there is no living, none,<br>

    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one<br>

    That I should love a bright particular star<br>

    And think to wed it, he is so above me.<br>

    In his bright radiance and collateral light<br>

    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.<br>

    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:<br>

    The hind that would be mated by the lion<br>

    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,<br>

    To see him every hour; to sit and draw<br>

    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,<br>

    In our heart's table-heart too capable<br>

    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.<br>

    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy<br>

    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00057">                       Enter PAROLLES</p>

<p id="id00058">    [Aside]  One that goes with him. I love him for his sake;<br>

    And yet I know him a notorious liar,<br>

    Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;<br>

    Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him<br>

    That they take place when virtue's steely bones<br>

    Looks bleak i' th' cold wind; withal, full oft we see<br>

    Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.<br>

  PAROLLES. Save you, fair queen!<br>

  HELENA. And you, monarch!<br>

  PAROLLES. No.<br>

  HELENA. And no.<br>

  PAROLLES. Are you meditating on virginity?<br>

  HELENA. Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask<br>

you a<br>

    question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it<br>

    against him?<br>

  PAROLLES. Keep him out.<br>

  HELENA. But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant in<br>

the<br>

    defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.<br>

  PAROLLES. There is none. Man, setting down before you, will<br>

    undermine you and blow you up.<br>

  HELENA. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and<br>

blowers-up!<br>

    Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?<br>

  PAROLLES. Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be<br>

blown<br>

    up; marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach<br>

yourselves<br>

     made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the<br>

commonwealth<br>

    of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is<br>

rational<br>

    increase; and there was never virgin got till virginity was<br>

first<br>

    lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins.<br>

Virginity<br>

    by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever<br>

kept, it<br>

    is ever lost. 'Tis too cold a companion; away with't.<br>

  HELENA. I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a<br>

    virgin.<br>

  PAROLLES. There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the<br>

rule<br>

    of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse<br>

your<br>

    mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs<br>

    himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be<br>

    buried in highways, out of all sanctified limit, as a<br>

desperate<br>

    offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like<br>

a<br>

    cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with<br>

    feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish,<br>

proud,<br>

    idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in<br>

the<br>

    canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by't. Out<br>

with't.<br>

    Within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly<br>

    increase; and the principal itself not much the worse. Away<br>

    with't.<br>

  HELENA. How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?<br>

  PAROLLES. Let me see. Marry, ill to like him that ne'er it<br>

likes.<br>

    'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer<br>

kept,<br>

    the less worth. Off with't while 'tis vendible; answer the<br>

time<br>

    of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap<br>

out of<br>

    fashion, richly suited but unsuitable; just like the brooch<br>

and<br>

    the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in<br>

your<br>

    pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity,<br>

    your old virginity, is like one of our French wither'd pears:<br>

it<br>

    looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a wither'd pear; it was<br>

    formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a wither'd pear. Will you<br>

    anything with it?<br>

  HELENA. Not my virginity yet.<br>

    There shall your master have a thousand loves,<br>

    A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,<br>

    A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,<br>

    A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,<br>

    A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;<br>

    His humble ambition, proud humility,<br>

    His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,<br>

    His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world<br>

    Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms<br>

    That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he-<br>

    I know not what he shall. God send him well!<br>

    The court's a learning-place, and he is one-<br>

  PAROLLES. What one, i' faith?<br>

  HELENA. That I wish well. 'Tis pity-<br>

  PAROLLES. What's pity?<br>

  HELENA. That wishing well had not a body in't<br>

    Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,<br>

    Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,<br>

    Might with effects of them follow our friends<br>

    And show what we alone must think, which never<br>

    Returns us thanks.<br>

    A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,<br>

    With caution, that the Florentine will move us<br>

    For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend<br>

    Prejudicates the business, and would seem<br>

    To have us make denial.<br>

  FIRST LORD. His love and wisdom,<br>

    Approv'd so to your Majesty, may plead<br>

    For amplest credence.<br>

  KING. He hath arm'd our answer,<br>

    Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,<br>

    Hath well compos'd thee. Thy father's moral parts<br>

    Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.<br>

  BERTRAM. My thanks and duty are your Majesty's.<br>

  KING. I would I had that corporal soundness now,<br>

    As when thy father and myself in friendship<br>

    First tried our soldiership. He did look far<br>

    Into the service of the time, and was<br>

    Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long;<br>

    But on us both did haggish age steal on,<br>

    And wore us out of act. It much repairs me<br>

    To talk of your good father. In his youth<br>

    He had the wit which I can well observe<br>

    To-day in our young lords; but they may jest<br>

    Till their own scorn return to them unnoted<br>

    Ere they can hide their levity in honour.<br>

    So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness<br>

    Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,<br>

    His equal had awak'd them; and his honour,<br>

    Clock to itself, knew the true minute when<br>

    Exception bid him speak, and at this time<br>

    His tongue obey'd his hand. Who were below him<br>

    He us'd as creatures of another place;<br>

    And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,<br>

    Making them proud of his humility<br>

    In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man<br>

    Might be a copy to these younger times;<br>

  KING. Would I were with him! He would always say-<br>

    Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words<br>

    He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them<br>

    To grow there, and to bear- 'Let me not live'-<br>

    This his good melancholy oft began,<br>

    On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,<br>

    When it was out-'Let me not live' quoth he<br>

    'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff<br>

    Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses<br>

    All but new things disdain; whose judgments are<br>

    Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies<br>

    Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd.<br>

then we<br>

    wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness of our<br>

deservings,<br>

    when of ourselves we publish them.<br>

  COUNTESS. What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The<br>

    complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe; 'tis my<br>

    slowness that I do not, for I know you lack not folly to<br>

commit<br>

will<br>

  COUNTESS. In what case?<br>

and I<br>

    think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have<br>

issue o'<br>

    my body; for they say bames are blessings.<br>

  COUNTESS. Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.<br>

  CLOWN. My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven on by the<br>

    flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.<br>

  COUNTESS. Is this all your worship's reason?<br>

  CLOWN. Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they<br>

are.<br>

  COUNTESS. May the world know them?<br>

  CLOWN. I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all<br>

flesh<br>

    and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent.<br>

  COUNTESS. Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.<br>

  CLOWN. I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have friends<br>

for<br>

    my wife's sake.<br>

  COUNTESS. Such friends are thine enemies, knave.<br>

  CLOWN. Y'are shallow, madam-in great friends; for the knaves<br>

come<br>

    to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land<br>

    spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop. If I be<br>

his<br>

    cuckold, he's my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the<br>

    cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh<br>

and<br>

    blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and<br>

blood<br>

    is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If<br>

men<br>

    could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in<br>

    marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the<br>

as<br>

    much love as she finds. There is more owing her than is paid;<br>

and<br>

    more shall be paid her than she'll demand.<br>

    wish'd me. Alone she was, and did communicate to herself her<br>

own<br>

    words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they<br>

    touch'd not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved<br>

your<br>

    son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such<br>

    difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would<br>

not<br>

    extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana no<br>

queen<br>

    of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris'd<br>

without<br>

    rescue in the first assault, or ransom afterward. This she<br>

    deliver'd in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er I<br>

heard<br>

    virgin exclaim in; which I held my duty speedily to acquaint<br>

you<br>

    withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns<br>

you<br>

    something to know it.<br>

  COUNTESS. YOU have discharg'd this honestly; keep it to<br>

yourself.<br>

    Many likelihoods inform'd me of this before, which hung so<br>

    tott'ring in the balance that I could neither believe nor<br>

    misdoubt. Pray you leave me. Stall this in your bosom; and I<br>

    thank you for your honest care. I will speak with you further<br>

<p id="id00074">                            Enter HELENA</p>

<p id="id00075">    Even so it was with me when I was young.<br>

    If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn<br>

    Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;<br>

    Our blood to us, this to our blood is born.<br>

    It is the show and seal of nature's truth,<br>

    Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth.<br>

    By our remembrances of days foregone,<br>

    Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.<br>

    Her eye is sick on't; I observe her now.<br>

  HELENA. What is your pleasure, madam?<br>

  COUNTESS. You know, Helen,<br>

    I am a mother to you.<br>

  HELENA. Mine honourable mistress.<br>

  COUNTESS. Nay, a mother.<br>

    Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'<br>

    Methought you saw a serpent. What's in 'mother'<br>

    That you start at it? I say I am your mother,<br>

    And put you in the catalogue of those<br>

    That were enwombed mine. 'Tis often seen<br>

    Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds<br>

    A native slip to us from foreign seeds.<br>

    You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,<br>

    Yet I express to you a mother's care.<br>

    God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood<br>

    To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,<br>

    That this distempered messenger of wet,<br>

    The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?<br>

    Why, that you are my daughter?<br>

  HELENA. That I am not.<br>

  COUNTESS. I say I am your mother.<br>

  HELENA. Pardon, madam.<br>

    The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:<br>

    I am from humble, he from honoured name;<br>

    No note upon my parents, his all noble.<br>

    My master, my dear lord he is; and I<br>

    His servant live, and will his vassal die.<br>

    He must not be my brother.<br>

  COUNTESS. Nor I your mother?<br>

  HELENA. You are my mother, madam; would you were-<br>

    So that my lord your son were not my brother-<br>

    Indeed my mother! Or were you both our mothers,<br>

    I care no more for than I do for heaven,<br>

    So I were not his sister. Can't no other,<br>

    But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?<br>

  COUNTESS. Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.<br>

    God shield you mean it not! 'daughter' and 'mother'<br>

    So strive upon your pulse. What! pale again?<br>

    My fear hath catch'd your fondness. Now I see<br>

    The myst'ry of your loneliness, and find<br>

    Your salt tears' head. Now to all sense 'tis gross<br>

    You love my son; invention is asham'd,<br>

    Against the proclamation of thy passion,<br>

    To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;<br>

    But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look, thy cheeks<br>

    Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes<br>

    See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours<br>

    That in their kind they speak it; only sin<br>

    And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,<br>

    That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?<br>

    If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;<br>

    If it be not, forswear't; howe'er, I charge thee,<br>

    As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,<br>

    To tell me truly.<br>

  HELENA. Good madam, pardon me.<br>

  COUNTESS. Do you love my son?<br>

  HELENA. Your pardon, noble mistress.<br>

  COUNTESS. Love you my son?<br>

  HELENA. Do not you love him, madam?<br>

  COUNTESS. Go not about; my love hath in't a bond<br>

    Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose<br>

    The state of your affection; for your passions<br>

    Have to the full appeach'd.<br>

  HELENA. Then I confess,<br>

    Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,<br>

    That before you, and next unto high heaven,<br>

    I love your son.<br>

    My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love.<br>

    Be not offended, for it hurts not him<br>

    That he is lov'd of me; I follow him not<br>

    By any token of presumptuous suit,<br>

    Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;<br>

    Yet never know how that desert should be.<br>

    I know I love in vain, strive against hope;<br>

    Yet in this captious and intenible sieve<br>

    I still pour in the waters of my love,<br>

    And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,<br>

    Religious in mine error, I adore<br>

    The sun that looks upon his worshipper<br>

    But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,<br>

    Let not your hate encounter with my love,<br>

    For loving where you do; but if yourself,<br>

    Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,<br>

    Did ever in so true a flame of liking<br>

    Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian<br>

    Was both herself and Love; O, then, give pity<br>

    To her whose state is such that cannot choose<br>

    But lend and give where she is sure to lose;<br>

    That seeks not to find that her search implies,<br>

    But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!<br>

  COUNTESS. Had you not lately an intent-speak truly-<br>

    To go to Paris?<br>

  HELENA. Madam, I had.<br>

  COUNTESS. Wherefore? Tell true.<br>

  HELENA. I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.<br>

    You know my father left me some prescriptions<br>

    Of rare and prov'd effects, such as his reading<br>

    And manifest experience had collected<br>

    For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me<br>

    In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,<br>

    As notes whose faculties inclusive were<br>

    More than they were in note. Amongst the rest<br>

    There is a remedy, approv'd, set down,<br>

    To cure the desperate languishings whereof<br>

    The King is render'd lost.<br>

  COUNTESS. This was your motive<br>

    For Paris, was it? Speak.<br>

  HELENA. My lord your son made me to think of this,<br>

    Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King,<br>

    Had from the conversation of my thoughts<br>

    Haply been absent then.<br>

  COUNTESS. But think you, Helen,<br>

    If you should tender your supposed aid,<br>

    He would receive it? He and his physicians<br>

    Are of a mind: he, that they cannot help him;<br>

    They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit<br>

    A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,<br>

    Embowell'd of their doctrine, have let off<br>

    The danger to itself?<br>

  HELENA. There's something in't<br>

    More than my father's skill, which was the great'st<br>

    Of his profession, that his good receipt<br>

    Shall for my legacy be sanctified<br>

    By th' luckiest stars in heaven; and, would your honour<br>

    But give me leave to try success, I'd venture<br>

    The well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure.<br>

    By such a day and hour.<br>

  COUNTESS. Dost thou believe't?<br>

  HELENA. Ay, madam, knowingly.<br>

  COUNTESS. Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,<br>

    Means and attendants, and my loving greetings<br>

    To those of mine in court. I'll stay at home,<br>

    And pray God's blessing into thy attempt.<br>

    Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,<br>

    What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.          Exeunt<br>

Paris. The KING'S palace</h2>

<p id="id00078">Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING with divers young LORDS
taking leave
for the Florentine war; BERTRAM and PAROLLES; ATTENDANTS</p>

<p id="id00079">  KING. Farewell, young lords; these war-like principles<br>

    Do not throw from you. And you, my lords, farewell;<br>

    Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,<br>

    The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis receiv'd,<br>

    And is enough for both.<br>

  FIRST LORD. 'Tis our hope, sir,<br>

    After well-ent'red soldiers, to return<br>

    And find your Grace in health.<br>

  KING. No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart<br>

    Will not confess he owes the malady<br>

    That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;<br>

    Whether I live or die, be you the sons<br>

    Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy-<br>

    Those bated that inherit but the fall<br>

    Of the last monarchy-see that you come<br>

    Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when<br>

    The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,<br>

    That fame may cry you aloud. I say farewell.<br>

  SECOND LORD. Health, at your bidding, serve your Majesty!<br>

  KING. Those girls of Italy, take heed of them;<br>

    They say our French lack language to deny,<br>

    If they demand; beware of being captives<br>

    Before you serve.<br>

    BOTH. Our hearts receive your warnings.<br>

  KING. Farewell.  [To ATTENDANTS]  Come hither to me.<br>

                                       The KING retires attended<br>

  FIRST LORD. O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!<br>

  PAROLLES. 'Tis not his fault, the spark.<br>

    SECOND LORD. O, 'tis brave wars!<br>

  PAROLLES. Most admirable! I have seen those wars.<br>

  BERTRAM. I am commanded here and kept a coil with<br>

    'Too young' and next year' and "Tis too early.'<br>

  PAROLLES. An thy mind stand to 't, boy, steal away bravely.<br>

  BERTRAM. I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,<br>

    Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,<br>

    Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn<br>

    But one to dance with. By heaven, I'll steal away.<br>

  FIRST LORD. There's honour in the theft.<br>

  PAROLLES. Commit it, Count.<br>

  SECOND LORD. I am your accessary; and so farewell.<br>

  BERTRAM. I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur'd body.<br>

  FIRST LORD. Farewell, Captain.<br>

  SECOND LORD. Sweet Monsieur Parolles!<br>

  PAROLLES. Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks<br>

and<br>

    lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment<br>

of<br>

    the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem<br>

of<br>

    war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword<br>

    entrench'd it. Say to him I live; and observe his reports for<br>

me.<br>

  FIRST LORD. We shall, noble Captain.<br>

  PAROLLES. Mars dote on you for his novices!       Exeunt LORDS<br>

    What will ye do?<br>
</p>

<p id="id00080">                            Re-enter the KING</p>

<p id="id00081">  BERTRAM. Stay; the King!<br>

  PAROLLES. Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you<br>

have<br>

    restrain'd yourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be<br>

more<br>

    expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of<br>

the<br>

    time; there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move, under<br>

the<br>

    influence of the most receiv'd star; and though the devil<br>

lead<br>

    the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and take a<br>

more<br>

    dilated farewell.<br>

  BERTRAM. And I will do so.<br>

  PAROLLES. Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy<br>

<p id="id00082">                              Enter LAFEU</p>

<p id="id00083">  LAFEU.  [Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.<br>

  KING. I'll fee thee to stand up.<br>

  LAFEU. Then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon.<br>

    I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy;<br>

    And that at my bidding you could so stand up.<br>

  KING. I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,<br>

    And ask'd thee mercy for't.<br>

  LAFEU. Good faith, across!<br>

    But, my good lord, 'tis thus: will you be cur'd<br>

    Of your infirmity?<br>

  KING. No.<br>

  LAFEU. O, will you eat<br>

    No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will<br>

    My noble grapes, an if my royal fox<br>

    Could reach them: I have seen a medicine<br>

    That's able to breathe life into a stone,<br>

    Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary<br>

    With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch<br>

    Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,<br>

    To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand<br>

    And write to her a love-line.<br>

  KING. What her is this?<br>

  LAFEU. Why, Doctor She! My lord, there's one arriv'd,<br>

    If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,<br>

    If seriously I may convey my thoughts<br>

    In this my light deliverance, I have spoke<br>

    With one that in her sex, her years, profession,<br>

    Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz'd me more<br>

    Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her,<br>

    For that is her demand, and know her business?<br>

    That done, laugh well at me.<br>

  KING. Now, good Lafeu,<br>

    Bring in the admiration, that we with the<br>

    May spend our wonder too, or take off thine<br>

    By wond'ring how thou took'st it.<br>

  LAFEU. Nay, I'll fit you,<br>

    And not be all day neither.                       Exit LAFEU<br>

  KING. Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00084">                   Re-enter LAFEU with HELENA</p>

<p id="id00085">  LAFEU. Nay, come your ways.<br>

  KING. This haste hath wings indeed.<br>

  LAFEU. Nay, come your ways;<br>

    This is his Majesty; say your mind to him.<br>

    A traitor you do look like; but such traitors<br>

    His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid's uncle,<br>

    That dare leave two together. Fare you well.            Exit<br>

  KING. Now, fair one, does your business follow us?<br>

  HELENA. Ay, my good lord.<br>

    Gerard de Narbon was my father,<br>

    In what he did profess, well found.<br>

  KING. I knew him.<br>

  HELENA. The rather will I spare my praises towards him;<br>

    Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death<br>

    Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one,<br>

    Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,<br>

    And of his old experience th' only darling,<br>

    He bade me store up as a triple eye,<br>

    Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so:<br>

    And, hearing your high Majesty is touch'd<br>

    With that malignant cause wherein the honour<br>

    Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,<br>

    I come to tender it, and my appliance,<br>

    With all bound humbleness.<br>

  KING. We thank you, maiden;<br>

    But may not be so credulous of cure,<br>

    When our most learned doctors leave us, and<br>

    The congregated college have concluded<br>

    That labouring art can never ransom nature<br>

    From her inaidable estate-I say we must not<br>

    So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,<br>

    To prostitute our past-cure malady<br>

    To empirics; or to dissever so<br>

    Our great self and our credit to esteem<br>

    A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.<br>

  HELENA. My duty then shall pay me for my pains.<br>

    I will no more enforce mine office on you;<br>

    Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts<br>

    A modest one to bear me back again.<br>

  KING. I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful.<br>

    Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give<br>

    As one near death to those that wish him live.<br>

    But what at full I know, thou know'st no part;<br>

    I knowing all my peril, thou no art.<br>

  HELENA. What I can do can do no hurt to try,<br>

    Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.<br>

    He that of greatest works is finisher<br>

    Oft does them by the weakest minister.<br>

    So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,<br>

    When judges have been babes. Great floods have flown<br>

    From simple sources, and great seas have dried<br>

    When miracles have by the greatest been denied.<br>

    Oft expectation fails, and most oft there<br>

    Where most it promises; and oft it hits<br>

    Where hope is coldest, and despair most fits.<br>

  KING. I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid;<br>

    Thy pains, not us'd, must by thyself be paid;<br>

    Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.<br>

  HELENA. Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd.<br>

    It is not so with Him that all things knows,<br>

    As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;<br>

    But most it is presumption in us when<br>

    The help of heaven we count the act of men.<br>

    Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;<br>

    Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.<br>

    I am not an impostor, that proclaim<br>

    Myself against the level of mine aim;<br>

    But know I think, and think I know most sure,<br>

    My art is not past power nor you past cure.<br>

  KING. Art thou so confident? Within what space<br>

    Hop'st thou my cure?<br>

  HELENA. The greatest Grace lending grace.<br>

    Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring<br>

    Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,<br>

    Ere twice in murk and occidental damp<br>

    Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,<br>

    Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass<br>

    Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,<br>

    What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,<br>

    Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.<br>

  KING. Upon thy certainty and confidence<br>

    What dar'st thou venture?<br>

  HELENA. Tax of impudence,<br>

    A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,<br>

    Traduc'd by odious ballads; my maiden's name<br>

    Sear'd otherwise; ne worse of worst-extended<br>

    With vilest torture let my life be ended.<br>

  KING. Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak<br>

    His powerful sound within an organ weak;<br>

    And what impossibility would slay<br>

    In common sense, sense saves another way.<br>

    Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate<br>

    Worth name of life in thee hath estimate:<br>

    Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all<br>

    That happiness and prime can happy call.<br>

    Thou this to hazard needs must intimate<br>

    Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.<br>

    Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,<br>

    That ministers thine own death if I die.<br>

  HELENA. If I break time, or flinch in property<br>

    Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die;<br>

    And well deserv'd. Not helping, death's my fee;<br>

    But, if I help, what do you promise me?<br>

  KING. Make thy demand.<br>

  HELENA. But will you make it even?<br>

  KING. Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.<br>

  HELENA. Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand<br>

    What husband in thy power I will command.<br>

    Exempted be from me the arrogance<br>

    To choose from forth the royal blood of France,<br>

    My low and humble name to propagate<br>

    With any branch or image of thy state;<br>

    But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know<br>

    Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.<br>

  KING. Here is my hand; the premises observ'd,<br>

    Thy will by my performance shall be serv'd.<br>

    So make the choice of thy own time, for I,<br>

    Thy resolv'd patient, on thee still rely.<br>

    More should I question thee, and more I must,<br>

    Though more to know could not be more to trust,<br>

    From whence thou cam'st, how tended on. But rest<br>

    Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.<br>

    Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed<br>

    As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.<br>

  COUNTESS. To the court! Why, what place make you special, when<br>

you<br>

    put off that with such contempt? But to the court!<br>

  CLOWN. Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may<br>

    easily put it off at court. He that cannot make a leg, put<br>

off's<br>

    cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands,<br>

lip,<br>

    nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not<br>

for<br>

    the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all men.<br>

  COUNTESS. Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all<br>

questions.<br>

  CLOWN. It is like a barber's chair, that fits all buttocks-the<br>

pin<br>

    buttock, the quatch buttock, the brawn buttock, or any<br>

buttock.<br>

  COUNTESS. Will your answer serve fit to all questions?<br>

  CLOWN. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as<br>

your<br>

    French crown for your taffety punk, as Tib's rush for Tom's<br>

    forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a morris for<br>

Mayday,<br>

    as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a<br>

scolding<br>

    quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the friar's<br>

    mouth; nay, as the pudding to his skin.<br>

  COUNTESS. Have you, I, say, an answer of such fitness for all<br>

    questions?<br>

  CLOWN. From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will<br>

fit<br>

    any question.<br>

  COUNTESS. It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must<br>

fit<br>

    all demands.<br>

  CLOWN. But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned<br>

should<br>

    speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to't. Ask<br>

me<br>

    if I am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.<br>

  COUNTESS. To be young again, if we could, I will be a fool in<br>

    question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you,<br>

sir,<br>

    are you a courtier?<br>

  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-There's a simple putting off. More, more, a<br>

    hundred of them.<br>

  COUNTESS. Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.<br>

  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Thick, thick; spare not me.<br>

  COUNTESS. I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.<br>

  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.<br>

  COUNTESS. You were lately whipp'd, sir, as I think.<br>

  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Spare not me.<br>

  COUNTESS. Do you cry 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and<br>

'spare<br>

    not me'? Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your<br>

    whipping. You would answer very well to a whipping, if you<br>

were<br>

    but bound to't.<br>

  CLOWN. I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!' I<br>

see<br>

    thing's may serve long, but not serve ever.<br>

  COUNTESS. I play the noble housewife with the time,<br>

    To entertain it so merrily with a fool.<br>

  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Why, there't serves well again.<br>

  COUNTESS. An end, sir! To your business: give Helen this,<br>

    And urge her to a present answer back;<br>

    Commend me to my kinsmen and my son. This is not much.<br>

  CLOWN. Not much commendation to them?<br>

  COUNTESS. Not much employment for you. You understand me?<br>

  CLOWN. Most fruitfully; I am there before my legs.<br>

  COUNTESS. Haste you again.                              Exeunt<br>

Paris. The KING'S palace</h2>

<p id="id00090">Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES</p>

<p id="id00091">  LAFEU. They say miracles are past; and we have our<br>

philosophical<br>

    persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and<br>

    causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors,<br>

    ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should<br>

submit<br>

    ourselves to an unknown fear.<br>

  PAROLLES. Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath<br>

shot<br>

    out in our latter times.<br>

  BERTRAM. And so 'tis.<br>

  LAFEU. To be relinquish'd of the artists-<br>

  PAROLLES. So I say-both of Galen and Paracelsus.<br>

  LAFEU. Of all the learned and authentic fellows-<br>

  PAROLLES. Right; so I say.<br>

  LAFEU. That gave him out incurable-<br>

  PAROLLES. Why, there 'tis; so say I too.<br>

  LAFEU. Not to be help'd-<br>

  PAROLLES. Right; as 'twere a man assur'd of a-<br>

  LAFEU. Uncertain life and sure death.<br>

  PAROLLES. Just; you say well; so would I have said.<br>

  LAFEU. I may truly say it is a novelty to the world.<br>

  PAROLLES. It is indeed. If you will have it in showing, you<br>

shall<br>

    read it in what-do-ye-call't here.<br>

  LAFEU.  [Reading the ballad title]  'A Showing of a Heavenly<br>

    Effect in an Earthly Actor.'<br>

  PAROLLES. That's it; I would have said the very same.<br>

  LAFEU. Why, your dolphin is not lustier. 'Fore me, I speak in<br>

    respect-<br>

  PAROLLES. Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange; that is the<br>

brief<br>

    and the tedious of it; and he's of a most facinerious spirit<br>

that<br>

    will not acknowledge it to be the-<br>

  PAROLLES. Ay; so I say.<br>

  LAFEU. In a most weak-<br>

transcendence;<br>

    which should, indeed, give us a further use to be made than<br>

<p id="id00093">  PAROLLES. I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the<br>

King.<br>

  LAFEU. Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I'll like a maid the<br>

better,<br>

    whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he's able to lead her<br>

    O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice<br>

    I have to use. Thy frank election make;<br>

    Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.<br>

  HELENA. To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress<br>

    Fall, when love please. Marry, to each but one!<br>

  LAFEU. I'd give bay Curtal and his furniture<br>

    My mouth no more were broken than these boys',<br>

    And writ as little beard.<br>

  KING. Peruse them well.<br>

    Not one of those but had a noble father.<br>

  HELENA. Gentlemen,<br>

    Heaven hath through me restor'd the King to health.<br>

  ALL. We understand it, and thank heaven for you.<br>

  HELENA. I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest<br>

    That I protest I simply am a maid.<br>

    Please it your Majesty, I have done already.<br>

    The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:<br>

    'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,<br>

    Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever,<br>

    We'll ne'er come there again.'<br>

  KING. Make choice and see:<br>

    Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.<br>

  HELENA. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,<br>

    And to imperial Love, that god most high,<br>

    Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?<br>

  FIRST LORD. And grant it.<br>

  HELENA. Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.<br>

  LAFEU. I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for<br>

my<br>

    life.<br>

  HELENA. The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,<br>

    Before I speak, too threat'ningly replies.<br>

    Love make your fortunes twenty times above<br>

    Her that so wishes, and her humble love!<br>

  SECOND LORD. No better, if you please.<br>

  HELENA. My wish receive,<br>

    Which great Love grant; and so I take my leave.<br>

  LAFEU. Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I'd have<br>

    them whipt; or I would send them to th' Turk to make eunuchs<br>

of.<br>

  HELENA. Be not afraid that I your hand should take;<br>

    I'll never do you wrong for your own sake.<br>

    Blessing upon your vows; and in your bed<br>

    Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!<br>

  LAFEU. These boys are boys of ice; they'll none have her.<br>

    Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne'er got<br>

'em.<br>

  HELENA. You are too young, too happy, and too good,<br>

    To make yourself a son out of my blood.<br>

  FOURTH LORD. Fair one, I think not so.<br>

  LAFEU. There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk<br>

wine-but<br>

    if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have<br>

known<br>

    thee already.<br>

  HELENA.  [To BERTRAM]  I dare not say I take you; but I give<br>

    Me and my service, ever whilst I live,<br>

    Into your guiding power. This is the man.<br>

  KING. Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.<br>

  BERTRAM. My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your Highness,<br>

    In such a business give me leave to use<br>

    The help of mine own eyes.<br>

  KING. Know'st thou not, Bertram,<br>

    What she has done for me?<br>

  BERTRAM. Yes, my good lord;<br>

    But never hope to know why I should marry her.<br>

  KING. Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed.<br>

  BERTRAM. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down<br>

    Must answer for your raising? I know her well:<br>

    She had her breeding at my father's charge.<br>

    A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain<br>

    Rather corrupt me ever!<br>

  KING. 'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which<br>

    I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,<br>

    Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,<br>

    Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off<br>

    In differences so mighty. If she be<br>

    All that is virtuous-save what thou dislik'st,<br>

    A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st<br>

    Of virtue for the name; but do not so.<br>

    From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,<br>

    The place is dignified by the doer's deed;<br>

    Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,<br>

    It is a dropsied honour. Good alone<br>

    Is good without a name. Vileness is so:<br>

    The property by what it is should go,<br>

    Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;<br>

    In these to nature she's immediate heir;<br>

    And these breed honour. That is honour's scorn<br>

    Which challenges itself as honour's born<br>

    And is not like the sire. Honours thrive<br>

    When rather from our acts we them derive<br>

    Than our fore-goers. The mere word's a slave,<br>

    Debauch'd on every tomb, on every grave<br>

    A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb<br>

    Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb<br>

    Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?<br>

    If thou canst like this creature as a maid,<br>

    I can create the rest. Virtue and she<br>

    Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.<br>

  BERTRAM. I cannot love her, nor will strive to do 't.<br>

  KING. Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.<br>

  HELENA. That you are well restor'd, my lord, I'm glad.<br>

    Let the rest go.<br>

  KING. My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,<br>

    I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,<br>

    Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,<br>

    That dost in vile misprision shackle up<br>

    My love and her desert; that canst not dream<br>

    We, poising us in her defective scale,<br>

    Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know<br>

    It is in us to plant thine honour where<br>

    We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;<br>

    Obey our will, which travails in thy good;<br>

    Believe not thy disdain, but presently<br>

    Do thine own fortunes that obedient right<br>

    Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;<br>

    Or I will throw thee from my care for ever<br>

    Into the staggers and the careless lapse<br>

    Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate<br>

    Loosing upon thee in the name of justice,<br>

    Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.<br>

  BERTRAM. Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit<br>

    My fancy to your eyes. When I consider<br>

    What great creation and what dole of honour<br>

    Flies where you bid it, I find that she which late<br>

    Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now<br>

    The praised of the King; who, so ennobled,<br>

    Is as 'twere born so.<br>

  KING. Take her by the hand,<br>

    And tell her she is thine; to whom I promise<br>

    A counterpoise, if not to thy estate<br>

    A balance more replete.<br>

  BERTRAM. I take her hand.<br>

  KING. Good fortune and the favour of the King<br>

    Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony<br>

    Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,<br>

    And be perform'd to-night. The solemn feast<br>

    Shall more attend upon the coming space,<br>

    Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her,<br>

    Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.<br>

              Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES who stay behind,<br>

                                      commenting of this wedding<br>

  LAFEU. Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.<br>

  PAROLLES. Your pleasure, sir?<br>

  LAFEU. Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.<br>

  PAROLLES. Recantation! My Lord! my master!<br>

  LAFEU. Ay; is it not a language I speak?<br>

  PAROLLES. A most harsh one, and not to be understood without<br>

bloody<br>

    succeeding. My master!<br>

  LAFEU. Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?<br>

  PAROLLES. To any count; to all counts; to what is man.<br>

  LAFEU. To what is count's man: count's master is of another<br>

style.<br>

  PAROLLES. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too<br>

    old.<br>

  LAFEU. I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title<br>

age<br>

    cannot bring thee.<br>

  PAROLLES. What I dare too well do, I dare not do.<br>

  LAFEU. I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty<br>

wise<br>

    fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it<br>

might<br>

    pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did<br>

manifoldly<br>

    dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a<br>

burden. I<br>

    have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care not; yet<br>

art<br>

    thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou'rt scarce<br>

    worth.<br>

  PAROLLES. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee-<br>

  LAFEU. Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten<br>

thy<br>

    trial; which if-Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my<br>

good<br>

    window of lattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not<br>

open,<br>

    for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.<br>

  PAROLLES. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.<br>

  LAFEU. Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.<br>

  PAROLLES. I have not, my lord, deserv'd it.<br>

  LAFEU. Yes, good faith, ev'ry dram of it; and I will not bate<br>

thee<br>

    a scruple.<br>

  PAROLLES. Well, I shall be wiser.<br>

  LAFEU. Ev'n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a<br>

smack<br>

    o' th' contrary. If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and<br>

    beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy<br>

bondage. I<br>

    have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my<br>

    knowledge, that I may say in the default 'He is a man I<br>

know.'<br>

  PAROLLES. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.<br>

  LAFEU. I would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my poor<br>

doing<br>

    eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by thee, in what<br>

motion<br>

    age will give me leave.                                 Exit<br>
</p>

<p id="id00096">  PAROLLES. Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off<br>

me:<br>

    scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient;<br>

    is no fettering of authority. I'll beat him, by my life, if I<br>

can<br>

    meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a<br>

    lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have of-<br>

    I'll beat him, and if I could but meet him again.<br>

    you; you have a new mistress.<br>

  PAROLLES. I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some<br>

    reservation of your wrongs. He is my good lord: whom I serve<br>

    above is my master.<br>

  LAFEU. Who? God?<br>

  PAROLLES. Ay, sir.<br>

  LAFEU. The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter<br>

up<br>

    thy arms o' this fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do<br>

other<br>

    servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose<br>

    stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'd<br>

beat<br>

    thee. Methink'st thou art a general offence, and every man<br>

should<br>

    beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe<br>

    themselves upon thee.<br>

  PAROLLES. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.<br>

  LAFEU. Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a<br>

kernel<br>

    out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true<br>

traveller;<br>

    you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than<br>

the<br>

    commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You<br>

are<br>

    not worth another word, else I'd call you knave. I leave you.<br>

very<br>

    well, and wants nothing i' th' world; but yet she is not<br>

  CLOWN. Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue<br>

shakes<br>

    out his master's undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to<br>

know<br>

    nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your<br>

    that's 'Before me th'art a knave.' This had been truth, sir.<br>

    his heart was not consenting to.<br>

  COUNTESS. Nothing in France until he have no wife!<br>

    There's nothing here that is too good for him<br>

    But only she; and she deserves a lord<br>

    That twenty such rude boys might tend upon,<br>

  SECOND GENTLEMAN. A servant only, and a gentleman<br>

    Which I have sometime known.<br>

  COUNTESS. Parolles, was it not?<br>

  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, my good lady, he.<br>

  COUNTESS. A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.<br>

    My son corrupts a well-derived nature<br>

    The fellow has a deal of that too much<br>

    Which holds him much to have.<br>

  COUNTESS. Y'are welcome, gentlemen.<br>

    I will entreat you, when you see my son,<br>

    To tell him that his sword can never win<br>

    The honour that he loses. More I'll entreat you<br>

    Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark<br>

    Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,<br>

    That ride upon the violent speed of fire,<br>

    Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,<br>

    That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.<br>

    Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;<br>

    Whoever charges on his forward breast,<br>

    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;<br>

<p id="id00134">  WIDOW. Nay, come; for if they do approach the city we shall<br>

service.<br>

  WIDOW. It is reported that he has taken their great'st<br>

commander;<br>

    and that with his own hand he slew the Duke's brother.<br>

[Tucket]<br>

    We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way. Hark!<br>

you<br>

    may know by their trumpets.<br>

  MARIANA. Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with<br>

the<br>

    report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl; the<br>

    honour of a maid is her name, and no legacy is so rich as<br>

    honesty.<br>

  WIDOW. I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by<br>

a<br>

    gentleman his companion.<br>

  MARIANA. I know that knave, hang him! one Parolles; a filthy<br>

    officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware<br>

of<br>

    them, Diana: their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and<br>

all<br>

    these engines of lust, are not the things they go under; many<br>

a<br>

    maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example,<br>

that<br>

    so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all<br>

that<br>

    dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs<br>

that<br>

    threatens them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but<br>

I<br>

    hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there<br>

    were no further danger known but the modesty which is so<br>

lost.<br>

  DIANA. You shall not need to fear me.<br>

her.<br>

    God save you, pilgrim! Whither are bound?<br>

  HELENA. To Saint Jaques le Grand.<br>

    Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?<br>

  HELENA. I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.<br>

  WIDOW. You came, I think, from France?<br>

  HELENA. I did so.<br>

  WIDOW. Here you shall see a countryman of yours<br>

    That has done worthy service.<br>

  HELENA. His name, I pray you.<br>

  DIANA. The Count Rousillon. Know you such a one?<br>

  HELENA. But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him;<br>

    His face I know not.<br>

  DIANA. What some'er he is,<br>

    He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,<br>

    As 'tis reported, for the King had married him<br>

    Against his liking. Think you it is so?<br>

  HELENA. Ay, surely, mere the truth; I know his lady.<br>

  DIANA. There is a gentleman that serves the Count<br>

    Reports but coarsely of her.<br>

  HELENA. What's his name?<br>

  DIANA. Monsieur Parolles.<br>

  HELENA. O, I believe with him,<br>

    In argument of praise, or to the worth<br>

    Of the great Count himself, she is too mean<br>

    To have her name repeated; all her deserving<br>

    Is a reserved honesty, and that<br>

    I have not heard examin'd.<br>

  DIANA. Alas, poor lady!<br>

    'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife<br>

    Of a detesting lord.<br>

  WIDOW. I sweet, good creature, wheresoe'er she is<br>

    Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do her<br>

    A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.<br>

    May be the amorous Count solicits her<br>

    In the unlawful purpose.<br>

  WIDOW. He does, indeed;<br>

    And brokes with all that can in such a suit<br>

    Corrupt the tender honour of a maid;<br>

Camp before Florence</h2>

<p id="id00141">Enter BERTRAM, and the two FRENCH LORDS</p>

<p id="id00142">  SECOND LORD. Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his<br>

way.<br>

  FIRST LORD. If your lordship find him not a hiding, hold me no<br>

more<br>

    in your respect.<br>

  SECOND LORD. On my life, my lord, a bubble.<br>

  BERTRAM. Do you think I am so far deceived in him?<br>

  SECOND LORD. Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,<br>

    without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a<br>

    most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly<br>

    promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your<br>

    lordship's entertainment.<br>

  FIRST LORD. It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in<br>

his<br>

    virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty<br>

    business in a main danger fail you.<br>

  BERTRAM. I would I knew in what particular action to try him.<br>

  FIRST LORD. None better than to let him fetch off his drum,<br>

which<br>

    you hear him so confidently undertake to do.<br>

  SECOND LORD. I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly<br>

surprise<br>

    him; such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the<br>

enemy.<br>

    We will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no<br>

other<br>

    but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries<br>

when<br>

    we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present<br>

at<br>

    his examination; if he do not, for the promise of his life<br>

and in<br>

    the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and<br>

    deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and<br>

that<br>

    with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my<br>

    judgment in anything.<br>

  FIRST LORD. O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his<br>

drum; he<br>

    says he has a stratagem for't. When your lordship sees the<br>

bottom<br>

    of his success in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump<br>

of<br>

    ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's<br>

    entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he<br>

comes.<br>

<p id="id00143">                      Enter PAROLLES</p>

<p id="id00144">  SECOND LORD. O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour<br>

of<br>

    his design; let him fetch off his drum in any hand.<br>

  BERTRAM. How now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your<br>

    disposition.<br>

  FIRST LORD. A pox on 't; let it go; 'tis but a drum.<br>

  PAROLLES. But a drum! Is't but a drum? A drum so lost! There<br>

was<br>

    excellent command: to charge in with our horse upon our own<br>

    wings, and to rend our own soldiers!<br>

  FIRST LORD. That was not to be blam'd in the command of the<br>

    service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could<br>

not<br>

    have prevented, if he had been there to command.<br>

  BERTRAM. Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success.<br>

    Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not<br>

to<br>

    be recovered.<br>

  PAROLLES. It might have been recovered.<br>

  BERTRAM. It might, but it is not now.<br>

  PAROLLES. It is to be recovered. But that the merit of service<br>

is<br>

    seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would<br>

have<br>

    that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.'<br>

  BERTRAM. Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur. If you<br>

think<br>

    your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour<br>

    again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the<br>

enterprise,<br>

    and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If<br>

you<br>

    speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it and extend<br>

to<br>

    you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost<br>

    syllable of our worthiness.<br>

  PAROLLES. By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.<br>

  BERTRAM. But you must not now slumber in it.<br>

  PAROLLES. I'll about it this evening; and I will presently pen<br>

    down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put<br>

myself<br>

    into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear<br>

further<br>

    from me.<br>

  BERTRAM. May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about<br>

it?<br>

  PAROLLES. I know not what the success will be, my lord, but the<br>

    attempt I vow.<br>

  BERTRAM. I know th' art valiant; and, to the possibility of thy<br>

soldiership,<br>

    will subscribe for thee. Farewell.<br>

  PAROLLES. I love not many words.                          Exit<br>

  SECOND LORD. No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a<br>

strange<br>

    fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this<br>

    business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to<br>

do,<br>

    and dares better be damn'd than to do 't.<br>

  FIRST LORD. You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it<br>

is<br>

    that he will steal himself into a man's favour, and for a<br>

week<br>

    escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him<br>

out,<br>

    you have him ever after.<br>

  BERTRAM. Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this<br>

that<br>

    so seriously he does address himself unto?<br>

  SECOND LORD. None in the world; but return with an invention,<br>

and<br>

    clap upon you two or three probable lies. But we have almost<br>

    emboss'd him. You shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he<br>

is<br>

    not for your lordship's respect.<br>

  FIRST LORD. We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case<br>

him.<br>

    He was first smok'd by the old Lord Lafeu. When his disguise<br>

and<br>

    he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which<br>

you<br>

    shall see this very night.<br>

  SECOND LORD. I must go look my twigs; he shall be caught.<br>

  BERTRAM. Your brother, he shall go along with me.<br>

  SECOND LORD. As't please your lordship. I'll leave you.   Exit<br>

  BERTRAM. Now will I lead you to the house, and show you<br>

    The lass I spoke of.<br>

  FIRST LORD. But you say she's honest.<br>

  BERTRAM. That's all the fault. I spoke with her but once,<br>

    And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,<br>

    By this same coxcomb that we have i' th' wind,<br>

    Tokens and letters which she did re-send;<br>

    And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature;<br>

    That she'll demand. A ring the County wears<br>

    That downward hath succeeded in his house<br>

    From son to son some four or five descents<br>

    Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds<br>

    In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,<br>

  HELENA. You see it lawful then. It is no more<br>

    But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,<br>

    Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;<br>

    In fine, delivers me to fill the time,<br>

was<br>

    guilty of.<br>

  PAROLLES. What the devil should move me to undertake the<br>

recovery<br>

    of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and<br>

    knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts,<br>

and<br>

    say I got them in exploit. Yet slight ones will not carry it.<br>

    They will say 'Came you off with so little?' And great ones I<br>

    dare not give. Wherefore, what's the instance? Tongue, I must<br>

put<br>

    you into a butterwoman's mouth, and buy myself another of<br>

    Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.<br>

  SECOND LORD. Is it possible he should know what he is, and be<br>

that<br>

    he is?<br>

  PAROLLES. I would the cutting of my garments would serve the<br>

turn,<br>

    or the breaking of my Spanish sword.<br>

  SECOND LORD. We cannot afford you so.<br>

  PAROLLES. Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in<br>

    stratagem.<br>

  SECOND LORD. 'Twould not do.<br>

  PAROLLES. Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripp'd.<br>

  SECOND LORD. Hardly serve.<br>

  PAROLLES. Though I swore I leap'd from the window of the<br>

citadel-<br>

  SECOND LORD. How deep?<br>

  PAROLLES. Thirty fathom.<br>

  SECOND LORD. Three great oaths would scarce make that be<br>

believed.<br>

  PAROLLES. I would I had any drum of the enemy's; I would swear<br>

I<br>

    recover'd it.<br>

  SECOND LORD. You shall hear one anon.          [Alarum within]<br>

  PAROLLES. A drum now of the enemy's!<br>

  SECOND LORD. Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.<br>

  ALL. Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo.<br>

  PAROLLES. O, ransom, ransom! Do not hide mine eyes.<br>

                                            [They blindfold him]<br>

  FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos thromuldo boskos.<br>

  PAROLLES. I know you are the Muskos' regiment,<br>

    And I shall lose my life for want of language.<br>

    If there be here German, or Dane, Low Dutch,<br>

    Italian, or French, let him speak to me;<br>

    I'll discover that which shall undo the Florentine.<br>

  FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos vauvado. I understand thee, and can speak<br>

thy<br>

    tongue. Kerely-bonto, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for<br>

    seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.<br>

  PAROLLES. O!<br>

  FIRST SOLDIER. O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.<br>

  SECOND LORD. Oscorbidulchos volivorco.<br>

  FIRST SOLDIER. The General is content to spare thee yet;<br>

    And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on<br>

    To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform<br>

    Something to save thy life.<br>

  PAROLLES. O, let me live,<br>

    And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,<br>

    Their force, their purposes. Nay, I'll speak that<br>

    Which you will wonder at.<br>

  FIRST SOLDIER. But wilt thou faithfully?<br>

  PAROLLES. If I do not, damn me.<br>

  FIRST SOLDIER. Acordo linta.<br>

    Come on; thou art granted space.<br>

                   Exit, PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within<br>

  SECOND LORD. Go, tell the Count Rousillon and my brother<br>

    We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled<br>

    Till we do hear from them.<br>

  SECOND SOLDIER. Captain, I will.<br>

  SECOND LORD. 'A will betray us all unto ourselves-<br>

    Inform on that.<br>

  SECOND SOLDIER. So I will, sir.<br>

  SECOND LORD. Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.<br>

Florence. The WIDOW'S house</h2>

<p id="id00155">Enter BERTRAM and DIANA</p>

<p id="id00156">  BERTRAM. They told me that your name was Fontibell.<br>

  DIANA. No, my good lord, Diana.<br>

  BERTRAM. Titled goddess;<br>

    And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,<br>

    In your fine frame hath love no quality?<br>

    If the quick fire of youth light not your mind,<br>

    You are no maiden, but a monument;<br>

    When you are dead, you should be such a one<br>

    As you are now, for you are cold and stern;<br>

    And now you should be as your mother was<br>

    When your sweet self was got.<br>

  DIANA. She then was honest.<br>

  BERTRAM. So should you be.<br>

  DIANA. No.<br>

    My mother did but duty; such, my lord,<br>

    As you owe to your wife.<br>

  BERTRAM. No more o'that!<br>

    I prithee do not strive against my vows.<br>

    I was compell'd to her; but I love thee<br>

    By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever<br>

    Do thee all rights of service.<br>

  DIANA. Ay, so you serve us<br>

    Till we serve you; but when you have our roses<br>

    You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,<br>

    And mock us with our bareness.<br>

  BERTRAM. How have I sworn!<br>

  DIANA. 'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,<br>

    But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.<br>

    What is not holy, that we swear not by,<br>

    But take the High'st to witness. Then, pray you, tell me:<br>

    If I should swear by Jove's great attributes<br>

    I lov'd you dearly, would you believe my oaths<br>

    When I did love you ill? This has no holding,<br>

    To swear by him whom I protest to love<br>

    That I will work against him. Therefore your oaths<br>

    Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd-<br>

    At least in my opinion.<br>

  BERTRAM. Change it, change it;<br>

    Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy;<br>

    And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts<br>

    That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,<br>

    But give thyself unto my sick desires,<br>

    Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever<br>

    My love as it begins shall so persever.<br>

  DIANA. I see that men make hopes in such a case<br>

    That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.<br>

  BERTRAM. I'll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power<br>

    To give it from me.<br>

  DIANA. Will you not, my lord?<br>

  BERTRAM. It is an honour 'longing to our house,<br>

    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;<br>

    Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world<br>

    In me to lose.<br>

  DIANA. Mine honour's such a ring:<br>

    My chastity's the jewel of our house,<br>

    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;<br>

    Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world<br>

    In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom<br>

    Brings in the champion Honour on my part<br>

    Against your vain assault.<br>

  BERTRAM. Here, take my ring;<br>

    My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,<br>

    And I'll be bid by thee.<br>

  DIANA. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber window;<br>

    I'll order take my mother shall not hear.<br>

    Now will I charge you in the band of truth,<br>

    When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,<br>

    Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:<br>

    My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them<br>

    When back again this ring shall be deliver'd.<br>

    And on your finger in the night I'll put<br>

    Another ring, that what in time proceeds<br>

    May token to the future our past deeds.<br>

    Adieu till then; then fail not. You have won<br>

    A wife of me, though there my hope be done.<br>

  BERTRAM. A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.<br>

 Exit<br>

  DIANA. For which live long to thank both heaven and me!<br>

    You may so in the end.<br>

    My mother told me just how he would woo,<br>

    As if she sat in's heart; she says all men<br>

    Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me<br>

    When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him<br>

    When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,<br>

    Marry that will, I live and die a maid.<br>

    Only, in this disguise, I think't no sin<br>

    To cozen him that would unjustly win.                   Exit<br>

The Florentine camp</h2>

<p id="id00158">Enter the two FRENCH LORDS, and two or three SOLDIERS</p>

<p id="id00159">  SECOND LORD. You have not given him his mother's letter?<br>

  FIRST LORD. I have deliv'red it an hour since. There is<br>

something<br>

    in't that stings his nature; for on the reading it he chang'd<br>

    almost into another man.<br>

  SECOND LORD. He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking<br>

off<br>

    so good a wife and so sweet a lady.<br>

  FIRST LORD. Especially he hath incurred the everlasting<br>

displeasure<br>

    of the King, who had even tun'd his bounty to sing happiness<br>

to<br>

    him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell<br>

darkly<br>

    with you.<br>

  SECOND LORD. When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the<br>

grave<br>

    of it.<br>

  FIRST LORD. He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in<br>

Florence,<br>

    of a most chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his will<br>

in<br>

    the spoil of her honour. He hath given her his monumental<br>

ring,<br>

    and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.<br>

  SECOND LORD. Now, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves,<br>
</p>

<p id="id00160" style="margin-top: 2em">    what things are we!<br>

  FIRST LORD. Merely our own traitors. And as in the common<br>

course of<br>

    all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they<br>

attain<br>

    to their abhorr'd ends; so he that in this action contrives<br>

    against his own nobility, in his proper stream, o'erflows<br>

    himself.<br>

  SECOND LORD. Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of<br>

our<br>

    unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company<br>

to-night?<br>

  FIRST LORD. Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his<br>

hour.<br>

  SECOND LORD. That approaches apace. I would gladly have him see<br>

his<br>

    company anatomiz'd, that he might take a measure of his own<br>

    judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.<br>

  FIRST LORD. We will not meddle with him till he come; for his<br>

    presence must be the whip of the other.<br>

  SECOND LORD. In the meantime, what hear you of these wars?<br>

  FIRST LORD. I hear there is an overture of peace.<br>

  SECOND LORD. Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.<br>

  FIRST LORD. What will Count Rousillon do then? Will he travel<br>

    higher, or return again into France?<br>

  SECOND LORD. I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether<br>
</p>

<p id="id00161" style="margin-top: 2em">    of his counsel.<br>

  FIRST LORD. Let it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal<br>

    of his act.<br>

  SECOND LORD. Sir, his wife, some two months since, fled from<br>

his<br>

    house. Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand;<br>

    which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she<br>

    accomplish'd; and, there residing, the tenderness of her<br>

nature<br>

    became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her<br>

last<br>

    breath, and now she sings in heaven.<br>

  FIRST LORD. How is this justified?<br>

  SECOND LORD. The stronger part of it by her own letters, which<br>

    makes her story true even to the point of her death. Her<br>

death<br>

    itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was<br>

    faithfully confirm'd by the rector of the place.<br>

  FIRST LORD. Hath the Count all this intelligence?<br>

  SECOND LORD. Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from<br>

    point, to the full arming of the verity.<br>

  FIRST LORD. I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.<br>

  SECOND LORD. How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our<br>

    losses!<br>

  FIRST LORD. And how mightily some other times we drown our gain<br>

in<br>

    tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir'd<br>

for<br>

    him shall at home be encount'red with a shame as ample.<br>

  SECOND LORD. The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and<br>

ill<br>

    together. Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipt them<br>

    not; and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish'd<br>

by<br>

    our virtues.<br>

taken<br>

    a solemn leave. His lordship will next morning for France.<br>

The<br>

    Duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the King.<br>

  SECOND LORD. They shall be no more than needful there, if they<br>

were<br>

    more than they can commend.<br>

<p id="id00165">    How now, my lord, is't not after midnight?<br>

  BERTRAM. I have to-night dispatch'd sixteen businesses, a<br>

month's<br>

    length apiece; by an abstract of success: I have congied with<br>

the<br>

    Duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourn'd<br>

for<br>

    her; writ to my lady mother I am returning; entertain'd my<br>

    convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected<br>

many<br>

    nicer needs. The last was the greatest, but that I have not<br>

ended<br>

    yet.<br>

  SECOND LORD. If the business be of any difficulty and this<br>

morning<br>

    your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.<br>

  BERTRAM. I mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear<br>

of it<br>

    hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the Fool<br>

and<br>

    the Soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module has<br>

  SECOND LORD. Bring him forth.  [Exeunt SOLDIERS]  Has sat i'<br>

th'<br>

  BERTRAM. No matter; his heels have deserv'd it, in usurping his<br>

    spurs so long. How does he carry himself?<br>

  SECOND LORD. I have told your lordship already the stocks carry<br>
</p>

<p id="id00166" style="margin-top: 2em">    him. But to answer you as you would be understood: he weeps<br>

like<br>

    a wench that had shed her milk; he hath confess'd himself to<br>

    Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his<br>

    remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i'<br>

th'<br>

    stocks. And what think you he hath confess'd?<br>

  BERTRAM. Nothing of me, has 'a?<br>

  SECOND LORD. His confession is taken, and it shall be read to<br>

his<br>

    face; if your lordship be in't, as I believe you are, you<br>

must<br>

    have the patience to hear it.<br>

  SECOND LORD. Hush, hush! Hoodman comes. Portotartarossa.
  FIRST SOLDIER. He calls for the tortures. What will you say
without
    'em?
  PAROLLES. I will confess what I know without constraint; if ye
    pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Bosko chimurcho.
  SECOND LORD. Boblibindo chicurmurco.
  FIRST SOLDIER. You are a merciful general. Our General bids you
    answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.
  PAROLLES. And truly, as I hope to live.
  FIRST SOLDIER. 'First demand of him how many horse the Duke is
    strong.' What say you to that?
  PAROLLES. Five or six thousand; but very weak and
unserviceable.
    The troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor
    rogues, upon my reputation and credit, and as I hope to live.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Shall I set down your answer so?
  PAROLLES. Do; I'll take the sacrament on 't, how and which way
you
    will.
  BERTRAM. All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!
  SECOND LORD. Y'are deceiv'd, my lord; this is Monsieur
Parolles,
    the gallant militarist-that was his own phrase-that had the
whole
    theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in
the
    chape of his dagger.
  FIRST LORD. I will never trust a man again for keeping his
sword
    clean; nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing
his
    apparel neatly.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.
  PAROLLES. 'Five or six thousand horse' I said-I will say true-
'or
    thereabouts' set down, for I'll speak truth.
  SECOND LORD. He's very near the truth in this.
  BERTRAM. But I con him no thanks for't in the nature he
delivers it.
  PAROLLES. 'Poor rogues' I pray you say.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.
  PAROLLES. I humbly thank you, sir. A truth's a truth-the rogues
are
    marvellous poor.
  FIRST SOLDIER. 'Demand of him of what strength they are
a-foot.'
    What say you to that?
  PAROLLES. By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present
hour, I
    will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty;
    Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many;
Guiltian,
    Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own
    company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred fifty each;
so
    that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts
not
    to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake
the
    snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to
    pieces.
  BERTRAM. What shall be done to him?
  SECOND LORD. Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
    condition, and what credit I have with the Duke.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down. 'You shall demand of him
    whether one Captain Dumain be i' th' camp, a Frenchman; what
his
    reputation is with the Duke, what his valour, honesty,
expertness
    in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with
    well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to a revolt.' What
say
    you to this? What do you know of it?
  PAROLLES. I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the
    inter'gatories. Demand them singly.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Do you know this Captain Dumain?
  PAROLLES. I know him: 'a was a botcher's prentice in Paris,
from
    whence he was whipt for getting the shrieve's fool with
child-a
    dumb innocent that could not say him nay.
  BERTRAM. Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his
    brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, is this captain in the Duke of Florence's
    camp?
  PAROLLES. Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.
  SECOND LORD. Nay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
    lordship anon.
  FIRST SOLDIER. What is his reputation with the Duke?
  PAROLLES. The Duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of
    mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' th'
band.
    I think I have his letter in my pocket.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Marry, we'll search.
  PAROLLES. In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or
it
    is upon a file with the Duke's other letters in my tent.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Here 'tis; here's a paper. Shall I read it to
you?
  PAROLLES. I do not know if it be it or no.
  BERTRAM. Our interpreter does it well.
  SECOND LORD. Excellently.
  FIRST SOLDIER.  [Reads]  'Dian, the Count's a fool, and full of
    gold.'
  PAROLLES. That is not the Duke's letter, sir; that is an
    advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to
take
    heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a foolish idle
    boy, but for all that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it
up
    again.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Nay, I'll read it first by your favour.
  PAROLLES. My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the
behalf
    of the maid; for I knew the young Count to be a dangerous and
    lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up
all
    the fry it finds.
  BERTRAM. Damnable both-sides rogue!
  FIRST SOLDIER.                                         [Reads]
    'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
    After he scores, he never pays the score.
    Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
    He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before.
    And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:
    Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;
    For count of this, the Count's a fool, I know it,
    Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
    Thine, as he vow'd to thee in thine ear,
                                                   PAROLLES.'
  BERTRAM. He shall be whipt through the army with this rhyme
in's
    forehead.
  FIRST LORD. This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold
    linguist, and the amnipotent soldier.
  BERTRAM. I could endure anything before but a cat, and now he's
a
    cat to me.
  FIRST SOLDIER. I perceive, sir, by our General's looks we shall
be
    fain to hang you.
  PAROLLES. My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid to
die,
    but that, my offences being many, I would repent out the
    remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' th'
    stocks, or anywhere, so I may live.
  FIRST SOLDIER. We'll see what may be done, so you confess
freely;
    therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you have
answer'd to
    his reputation with the Duke, and to his valour; what is his
    honesty?
  PAROLLES. He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister; for
rapes
    and ravishments he parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping
of
    oaths; in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules. He will
lie,
    sir, with such volubility that you would think truth were a
fool.
    Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk;
and
    in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bedclothes
about
    him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. I
have
    but little more to say, sir, of his honesty. He has
everything
    that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should
    have he has nothing.
  SECOND LORD. I begin to love him for this.
  BERTRAM. For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him!
For
    me, he's more and more a cat.
  FIRST SOLDIER. What say you to his expertness in war?
  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, has led the drum before the English
    tragedians-to belie him I will not-and more of his
soldier-ship
    I know not, except in that country he had the honour to be
the
    officer at a place there called Mile-end to instruct for the
    doubling of files-I would do the man what honour I can-but of
    this I am not certain.
  SECOND LORD. He hath out-villain'd villainy so far that the
rarity
    redeems him.
  BERTRAM. A pox on him! he's a cat still.
  FIRST SOLDIER. His qualities being at this poor price, I need
not
    to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
  PAROLLES. Sir, for a cardecue he will sell the fee-simple of
his
    salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut th' entail from all</p>

<p id="id00169" style="margin-top: 2em">    remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.<br>

  FIRST SOLDIER. What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?<br>

  FIRST LORD. Why does he ask him of me?<br>

  FIRST SOLDIER. What's he?<br>

  PAROLLES. E'en a crow o' th' same nest; not altogether so great<br>

as<br>

    the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He<br>

    excels his brother for a coward; yet his brother is reputed<br>

one<br>

    of the best that is. In a retreat he outruns any lackey:<br>

marry,<br>

    in coming on he has the cramp.<br>

  FIRST SOLDIER. If your life be saved, will you undertake to<br>

betray<br>

    the Florentine?<br>

  PAROLLES. Ay, and the Captain of his Horse, Count Rousillon.<br>

  FIRST SOLDIER. I'll whisper with the General, and know his<br>

    pleasure.<br>

  PAROLLES.  [Aside]  I'll no more drumming. A plague of all<br>

drums!<br>

    Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition<br>

of<br>

    that lascivious young boy the Count, have I run into this<br>

danger.<br>

    Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?<br>

  FIRST SOLDIER. There is no remedy, sir, but you must die.<br>

    The General says you that have so traitorously discover'd the<br>
</p>

<p id="id00170" style="margin-top: 2em">    secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of<br>

men<br>

    very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use;<br>

therefore<br>

    you must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.<br>

  PAROLLES. O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!<br>

  FIRST SOLDIER. That shall you, and take your leave of all your<br>

    friends.  [Unmuffling him]  So look about you; know you any<br>

here?<br>

  BERTRAM. Good morrow, noble Captain.<br>

  FIRST LORD. God bless you, Captain Parolles.<br>

  SECOND LORD. God save you, noble Captain.<br>

  FIRST LORD. Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu? I<br>

am<br>

    for France.<br>

  SECOND LORD. Good Captain, will you give me a copy of the<br>

sonnet<br>

    you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon? An I were<br>

not<br>

    a very coward I'd compel it of you; but fare you well.<br>

                                        Exeunt BERTRAM and LORDS<br>

  FIRST SOLDIER. You are undone, Captain, all but your scarf;<br>

that<br>

    has a knot on 't yet.<br>

  PAROLLES. Who cannot be crush'd with a plot?<br>

  FIRST SOLDIER. If you could find out a country where but women<br>

were<br>

    that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent<br>
</p>

<p id="id00171">    nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France too; we shall<br>

speak of<br>

    you there.                                Exit with SOLDIERS<br>

  PAROLLES. Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great,<br>

    'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;<br>

    But I will eat, and drink, and sleep as soft<br>

    As captain shall. Simply the thing I am<br>

    Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,<br>

    Let him fear this; for it will come to pass<br>

    That every braggart shall be found an ass.<br>

    Rust, sword; cool, blushes; and, Parolles, live<br>

    Safest in shame. Being fool'd, by fool'ry thrive.<br>

    There's place and means for every man alive.<br>

    I'll after them.                                        Exit<br>

Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace</h2>

<p id="id00176">Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and CLOWN</p>

<p id="id00177" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  LAFEU. No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta
fellow
    there, whose villainous saffron would have made all the
unbak'd
    and doughy youth of a nation in his colour. Your
daughter-in-law
    had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more
    advanc'd by the King than by that red-tail'd humble-bee I
speak
    of.
  COUNTESS. I would I had not known him. It was the death of the
most
    virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for
creating. If
    she had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest groans
of a
    mother, I could not have owed her a more rooted love.
  LAFEU. 'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady. We may pick a
thousand
    sallets ere we light on such another herb.
  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, she was the sweet-marjoram of the sallet,
or,
    rather, the herb of grace.
  LAFEU. They are not sallet-herbs, you knave; they are
nose-herbs.
  CLOWN. I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill
in
    grass.
  LAFEU. Whether dost thou profess thyself-a knave or a fool?
  CLOWN. A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a
man's.
  LAFEU. Your distinction?
  CLOWN. I would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.
  LAFEU. So you were a knave at his service, indeed.
  CLOWN. And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her
service.
  LAFEU. I will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.
  CLOWN. At your service.
  LAFEU. No, no, no.
  CLOWN. Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a
    prince as you are.
  LAFEU. Who's that? A Frenchman?
  CLOWN. Faith, sir, 'a has an English name; but his fisnomy is
more
    hotter in France than there.
  LAFEU. What prince is that?
  CLOWN. The Black Prince, sir; alias, the Prince of Darkness;
alias,
    the devil.
  LAFEU. Hold thee, there's my purse. I give thee not this to
suggest
    thee from thy master thou talk'st of; serve him still.
  CLOWN. I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great
fire;
    and the master I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But, sure,
he
    is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in's
court. I
    am for the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be too
    little for pomp to enter. Some that humble themselves may;
but
    the many will be too chill and tender: and they'll be for the
    flow'ry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  LAFEU. Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I tell
thee
    so before, because I would not fall out with thee. Go thy
ways;
    let my horses be well look'd to, without any tricks.
  CLOWN. If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be jades'
    tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature.
 Exit
  LAFEU. A shrewd knave, and an unhappy.
  COUNTESS. So 'a is. My lord that's gone made himself much
sport
    out of him. By his authority he remains here, which he thinks
is
    a patent for his sauciness; and indeed he has no pace, but
runs
    where he will.
  LAFEU. I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to tell
    you, since I heard of the good lady's death, and that my lord
    your son was upon his return home, I moved the King my master
to
    speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of
    them both, his Majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did
    first propose. His Highness hath promis'd me to do it; and,
to
    stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son,
there
    is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?
  COUNTESS. With very much content, my lord; and I wish it
happily
    effected.
  LAFEU. His Highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body
as
    when he number'd thirty; 'a will be here to-morrow, or I am
    deceiv'd by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail'd.
  COUNTESS. It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die.
    I have letters that my son will be here to-night. I shall
beseech
    your lordship to remain with me till they meet together.
  LAFEU. Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely
be
    admitted.
  COUNTESS. You need but plead your honourable privilege.
  LAFEU. Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but, I thank
my
    God, it holds yet.</p>

<p id="id00179">  CLOWN. O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of<br>

    knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of velvet. His left cheek is a<br>

    cheek of two pile and a half, but his right cheek is worn<br>

bare.<br>

  LAFEU. A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liv'ry of<br>

  KING. Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me<br>

    That sets him high in fame.<br>
</p>

<p id="id00194">                          Enter BERTRAM</p>

<p id="id00195">  LAFEU. He looks well on 't.<br>

  KING. I am not a day of season,<br>

    For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail<br>

    In me at once. But to the brightest beams<br>

    Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;<br>

    The time is fair again.<br>

  BERTRAM. My high-repented blames,<br>

    Dear sovereign, pardon to me.<br>

  KING. All is whole;<br>

    Not one word more of the consumed time.<br>

    Let's take the instant by the forward top;<br>

    For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees<br>

    Th' inaudible and noiseless foot of Time<br>

    Steals ere we can effect them. You remember<br>

    The daughter of this lord?<br>

  BERTRAM. Admiringly, my liege. At first<br>

    I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart<br>

    Durst make too bold herald of my tongue;<br>

    Where the impression of mine eye infixing,<br>

    Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,<br>

    Which warp'd the line of every other favour,<br>

    Scorn'd a fair colour or express'd it stol'n,<br>

    Extended or contracted all proportions<br>

    To a most hideous object. Thence it came<br>

    That she whom all men prais'd, and whom myself,<br>

    Since I have lost, have lov'd, was in mine eye<br>

    The dust that did offend it.<br>

  KING. Well excus'd.<br>

    That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away<br>

    From the great compt; but love that comes too late,<br>

    Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,<br>

    To the great sender turns a sour offence,<br>

    Crying 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults<br>

    Make trivial price of serious things we have,<br>

    Not knowing them until we know their grave.<br>

    Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,<br>

    Destroy our friends, and after weep their dust;<br>

    Our own love waking cries to see what's done,<br>

    While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.<br>

    Be this sweet Helen's knell. And now forget her.<br>

    Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.<br>

    The main consents are had; and here we'll stay<br>

    To see our widower's second marriage-day.<br>

  COUNTESS. Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!<br>

    Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!<br>

  LAFEU. Come on, my son, in whom my house's name<br>

    Must be digested; give a favour from you,<br>

    To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,<br>

    That she may quickly come.<br>

                                          [BERTRAM gives a ring]<br>

    By my old beard,<br>

    And ev'ry hair that's on 't, Helen, that's dead,<br>

    Was a sweet creature; such a ring as this,<br>

    The last that e'er I took her leave at court,<br>

    I saw upon her finger.<br>

  BERTRAM. Hers it was not.<br>

  KING. Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,<br>

    While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.<br>

    This ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen<br>

    I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood<br>

    Necessitied to help, that by this token<br>

    I would relieve her. Had you that craft to reave her<br>

    Of what should stead her most?<br>

  BERTRAM. My gracious sovereign,<br>

    Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,<br>

    The ring was never hers.<br>

  COUNTESS. Son, on my life,<br>

    I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it<br>

    At her life's rate.<br>

  LAFEU. I am sure I saw her wear it.<br>

  BERTRAM. You are deceiv'd, my lord; she never saw it.<br>

    In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,<br>

    Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name<br>

    Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought<br>

    I stood engag'd; but when I had subscrib'd<br>

    To mine own fortune, and inform'd her fully<br>

    I could not answer in that course of honour<br>

    As she had made the overture, she ceas'd,<br>

    In heavy satisfaction, and would never<br>

    Receive the ring again.<br>

  KING. Plutus himself,<br>

    That knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine,<br>

    Hath not in nature's mystery more science<br>

    Than I have in this ring. 'Twas mine, 'twas Helen's,<br>

    Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know<br>

    That you are well acquainted with yourself,<br>

    Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement<br>

    You got it from her. She call'd the saints to surety<br>

    That she would never put it from her finger<br>

    Unless she gave it to yourself in bed-<br>

    Where you have never come- or sent it us<br>

    Upon her great disaster.<br>

  BERTRAM. She never saw it.<br>

  KING. Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;<br>

    And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me<br>

    Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove<br>

    That thou art so inhuman- 'twill not prove so.<br>

    And yet I know not- thou didst hate her deadly,<br>

    And she is dead; which nothing, but to close<br>

    Her eyes myself, could win me to believe<br>

    More than to see this ring. Take him away.<br>

                                          [GUARDS seize BERTRAM]<br>

    My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,<br>

    Shall tax my fears of little vanity,<br>

    Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him.<br>

    We'll sift this matter further.<br>

  BERTRAM. If you shall prove<br>

    This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy<br>

    Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,<br>

    Where she yet never was.                       Exit, guarded<br>

  KING. I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.<br>

    Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:<br>

    Here's a petition from a Florentine,<br>

    Who hath, for four or five removes, come short<br>

    To tender it herself. I undertook it,<br>

    Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech<br>

    Of the poor suppliant, who by this, I know,<br>

    Is here attending; her business looks in her<br>

    With an importing visage; and she told me<br>

    In a sweet verbal brief it did concern<br>

    Your Highness with herself.<br>

  KING.  [Reads the letter]  'Upon his many protestations to<br>

marry me<br>

    when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is<br>

the<br>

    Count Rousillon a widower; his vows are forfeited to me, and<br>

my<br>

    honour's paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no<br>

leave,<br>

    and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O<br>

King!<br>

                                               Exeunt ATTENDANTS<br>

    I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,<br>

<p id="id00198">                       Enter BERTRAM, guarded</p>

<p id="id00199">  KING. I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you.<br>

    And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,<br>

    Yet you desire to marry.<br>

                                           Enter WIDOW and DIANA<br>

    What woman's that?<br>

  DIANA. I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,<br>

    Derived from the ancient Capilet.<br>

    My suit, as I do understand, you know,<br>

    And therefore know how far I may be pitied.<br>

  WIDOW. I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour<br>

    Both suffer under this complaint we bring,<br>

    And both shall cease, without your remedy.<br>

  KING. Come hither, Count; do you know these women?<br>

  BERTRAM. My lord, I neither can nor will deny<br>

    But that I know them. Do they charge me further?<br>

  DIANA. Why do you look so strange upon your wife?<br>

  BERTRAM. She's none of mine, my lord.<br>

  DIANA. If you shall marry,<br>

    You give away this hand, and that is mine;<br>

    You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;<br>

    You give away myself, which is known mine;<br>

    For I by vow am so embodied yours<br>

    That she which marries you must marry me,<br>

    Either both or none.<br>

  LAFEU.  [To BERTRAM]  Your reputation comes too short for<br>

    my daughter; you are no husband for her.<br>

  BERTRAM. My lord, this is a fond and desp'rate creature<br>

    Whom sometime I have laugh'd with. Let your Highness<br>

    Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour<br>

    Than for to think that I would sink it here.<br>

  KING. Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend<br>

    Till your deeds gain them. Fairer prove your honour<br>

    Than in my thought it lies!<br>

  DIANA. Good my lord,<br>

    Ask him upon his oath if he does think<br>

    He had not my virginity.<br>

  KING. What say'st thou to her?<br>

  BERTRAM. She's impudent, my lord,<br>

    And was a common gamester to the camp.<br>

  DIANA. He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so<br>

    He might have bought me at a common price.<br>

    Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,<br>

    Whose high respect and rich validity<br>

    Did lack a parallel; yet, for all that,<br>

    He gave it to a commoner o' th' camp,<br>

    If I be one.<br>

  COUNTESS. He blushes, and 'tis it.<br>

    Of six preceding ancestors, that gem<br>

    Conferr'd by testament to th' sequent issue,<br>

    Hath it been ow'd and worn. This is his wife:<br>

    That ring's a thousand proofs.<br>

  KING. Methought you said<br>

    You saw one here in court could witness it.<br>

  DIANA. I did, my lord, but loath am to produce<br>

    So bad an instrument; his name's Parolles.<br>

  LAFEU. I saw the man to-day, if man he be.<br>

  KING. Find him, and bring him hither.        Exit an ATTENDANT<br>

  BERTRAM. What of him?<br>

    He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,<br>

    With all the spots o' th' world tax'd and debauch'd,<br>

    Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.<br>

    Am I or that or this for what he'll utter<br>

    That will speak anything?<br>

  KING. She hath that ring of yours.<br>

  BERTRAM. I think she has. Certain it is I lik'd her,<br>

    And boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth.<br>

    She knew her distance, and did angle for me,<br>

    Madding my eagerness with her restraint,<br>

    As all impediments in fancy's course<br>

    Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,<br>

    Her infinite cunning with her modern grace<br>

    Subdu'd me to her rate. She got the ring;<br>

    And I had that which any inferior might<br>

    At market-price have bought.<br>

  DIANA. I must be patient.<br>

    You that have turn'd off a first so noble wife<br>

    May justly diet me. I pray you yet-<br>

    Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband-<br>

    Send for your ring, I will return it home,<br>

    And give me mine again.<br>

  BERTRAM. I have it not.<br>

  KING. What ring was yours, I pray you?<br>

  DIANA. Sir, much like<br>

    The same upon your finger.<br>

  KING. Know you this ring? This ring was his of late.<br>

  DIANA. And this was it I gave him, being abed.<br>

  KING. The story, then, goes false you threw it him<br>

    Out of a casement.<br>

  DIANA. I have spoke the truth.<br>

  KING. You boggle shrewdly; every feather starts you.<br>

    Is this the man you speak of?<br>

  DIANA. Ay, my lord.<br>

  KING. Tell me, sirrah-but tell me true I charge you,<br>

    Not fearing the displeasure of your master,<br>

    Which, on your just proceeding, I'll keep off-<br>

    By him and by this woman here what know you?<br>

  PAROLLES. So please your Majesty, my master hath been an<br>

honourable<br>

    gentleman; tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.<br>

  KING. Come, come, to th' purpose. Did he love this woman?<br>

  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?<br>

  KING. How, I pray you?<br>

  PAROLLES. He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.<br>

  KING. How is that?<br>

  PAROLLES. He lov'd her, sir, and lov'd her not.<br>

  KING. As thou art a knave and no knave.<br>

    What an equivocal companion is this!<br>

  PAROLLES. I am a poor man, and at your Majesty's command.<br>

  LAFEU. He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.<br>

  DIANA. Do you know he promis'd me marriage?<br>

  PAROLLES. Faith, I know more than I'll speak.<br>

  KING. But wilt thou not speak all thou know'st?<br>

  PAROLLES. Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go between them,<br>

as I<br>

    said; but more than that, he loved her-for indeed he was mad<br>

for<br>

    her, and talk'd of Satan, and of Limbo, and of Furies, and I<br>

know<br>

    not what. Yet I was in that credit with them at that time<br>

that I<br>

    knew of their going to bed; and of other motions, as<br>

promising<br>

    her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to<br>

speak<br>

    of; therefore I will not speak what I know.<br>

  KING. Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they<br>

are<br>

    married; but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore<br>

stand<br>

    aside.<br>

    This ring, you say, was yours?<br>

  DIANA. Ay, my good lord.<br>

  KING. Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?<br>

  DIANA. It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.<br>

  KING. Who lent it you?<br>

  DIANA. It was not lent me neither.<br>

  KING. Where did you find it then?<br>

  DIANA. I found it not.<br>

  KING. If it were yours by none of all these ways,<br>

    How could you give it him?<br>

  DIANA. I never gave it him.<br>

  LAFEU. This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off and on<br>

at<br>

    pleasure.<br>

  KING. This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.<br>

  DIANA. It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.<br>

  KING. Take her away, I do not like her now;<br>

    To prison with her. And away with him.<br>

    Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,<br>

    Thou diest within this hour.<br>

  DIANA. I'll never tell you.<br>

  KING. Take her away.<br>

  DIANA. I'll put in bail, my liege.<br>

  KING. I think thee now some common customer.<br>

  DIANA. By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.<br>

  KING. Wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while?<br>

  DIANA. Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty.<br>

    He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't:<br>

    I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.<br>

    Great King, I am no strumpet, by my life;<br>

    I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.<br>

                                             [Pointing to LAFEU]<br>

    The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,<br>

    And he shall surety me. But for this lord<br>

    Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself,<br>

    Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him.<br>

    He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd;<br>

    And at that time he got his wife with child.<br>

    Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick;<br>

    So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick-<br>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>

Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
