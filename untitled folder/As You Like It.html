ORLANDO.<br>
As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a
thousand crowns, and, as thou sayst, charged my brother, on his blessing, to
breed me well; and there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at
school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me
rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept;
for call you that keeping, for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from
the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for, besides that they are
fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage and to that end riders
dearly hired; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the
which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this
nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his
countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the
place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father,
which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no
longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Oliver</span>.</p>
<p class="drama">
ADAM.<br>
Yonder comes my master, your brother.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up.
</p>
<p class="right">[<i><span class="charname">Adam</span> retires.</i>]</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Now, sir, what make you here?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Nothing. I am not taught to make anything.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
What mar you then, sir?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poor unworthy
brother of yours, with idleness.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What prodigal portion have I
spent that I should come to such penury?
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Know you where you are, sir?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
O, sir, very well: here in your orchard.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Know you before whom, sir?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are my eldest brother, and
in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me. The courtesy of
nations allows you my better in that you are the first-born, but the same
tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I
have as much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming before
me is nearer to his reverence.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
What, boy!
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I am no villain. I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys; he was my
father, and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains. Wert
thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other
had pulled out thy tongue for saying so. Thou has railed on thyself.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADAM.<br>
[<i>Coming forward</i>.] Sweet masters, be patient. For your father’s
remembrance, be at accord.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Let me go, I say.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I will not till I please. You shall hear me. My father charged you in his will
to give me good education. You have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and
hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows
strong in me, and I will no longer endure it. Therefore allow me such
exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father
left me by testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
And what wilt thou do? Beg when that is spent? Well, sir, get you in. I will
not long be troubled with you. You shall have some part of your will. I pray
you leave me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Get you with him, you old dog.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADAM.<br>
Is “old dog” my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in your service. God be
with my old master. He would not have spoke such a word.

<p class="drama">
CHARLES.<br>
Good morrow to your worship.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Good Monsieur Charles. What’s the new news at the new court?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARLES.<br>
There’s no news at the court, sir, but the old news. That is, the old Duke is
banished by his younger brother the new Duke, and three or four loving lords
have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and revenues
enrich the new Duke; therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke’s daughter, be banished with her father?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARLES.<br>
O, no; for the Duke’s daughter, her cousin, so loves her, being ever from their
cradles bred together, that she would have followed her exile or have died to
stay behind her. She is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his
own daughter, and never two ladies loved as they do.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Where will the old Duke live?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARLES.<br>
They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him;
and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say many young
gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in
the golden world.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new Duke?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARLES.<br>
Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter. I am given, sir,
secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
to come in disguised against me to try a fall. Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my
credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.
Your brother is but young and tender, and for your love I would be loath to
foil him, as I must for my own honour if he come in. Therefore, out of my
love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay
him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in
that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most
kindly requite. I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein, and have by
underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I’ll tell
thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition,
an envious emulator of every man’s good parts, a secret and villainous
contriver against me his natural brother. Therefore use thy discretion. I had
as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to’t;
for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace
himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta’en thy life by some
indirect means or other. For I assure thee (and almost with tears I speak it)
there is not one so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but
brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and
weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHARLES.<br>
I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come tomorrow I’ll give him his
payment. If ever he go alone again I’ll never wrestle for prize more. And so,
God keep your worship.
</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an
end of him; for my soul—yet I know not why—hates nothing more than he. Yet
he’s gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts
enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and
especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprized.
But it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all. Nothing remains but
that I kindle the boy thither, which now I’ll go about.

CELIA.<br>
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were
merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CELIA.<br>
Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that I love thee. If my
uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the Duke my father, so thou
hadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for
mine. So wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
tempered as mine is to thee.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CELIA.<br>
You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to have; and truly,
when he dies thou shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
father perforce, I will render thee again in affection. By mine honour I will!
And when I break that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet Rose, my
dear Rose, be merry.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let me see—what think you of
falling in love?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CELIA.<br>
Marry, I prithee do, to make sport withal; but love no man in good earnest,
nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in
honour come off again.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
What shall be our sport, then?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CELIA.<br>
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts
may henceforth be bestowed equally.
</p>
<p class="drama">

I would we could do so, for her benefits are mightily misplaced, and the
bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.

No? When Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the

Peradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither, but Nature’s, who perceiveth
our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent this

<p class="drama">

Mistress, you must come away to your father.

<p class="drama">

Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes, and swore
by his honour the mustard was naught. Now, I’ll stand to it, the pancakes were
naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
</p>

you are not forsworn. No more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those

Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
</p>
<p class="drama">

I will tell you the beginning and, if it please your ladyships, you may see
the end, for the best is yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming to
perform it.
</p>
<p class="drama">

Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.
</p>
<p class="drama">

<p class="drama">

The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke’s wrestler, which
Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is
little hope of life in him. So he served the second, and so the third. Yonder
they lie, the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them
that all the beholders take his part with weeping.

one shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that is willing to
be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world

Would he not be a comfort to our travel?

After my flight. Now go we in content<br>
To liberty, and not to banishment.

<h3> <b>SCENE I. The Forest of Arden</b></h3>
<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Duke Senior, Amiens</span>
and two or three Lords, dressed as foresters.</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE SENIOR.<br>
Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,<br>
Hath not old custom made this life more sweet<br>
Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods<br>
More free from peril than the envious court?<br>
Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,<br>
The seasons’ difference, as the icy fang<br>
And churlish chiding of the winter’s wind,<br>
Which when it bites and blows upon my body<br>
Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say:<br>
“This is no flattery. These are counsellors<br>
That feelingly persuade me what I am.”<br>
Sweet are the uses of adversity,<br>
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,<br>
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;<br>
And this our life, exempt from public haunt,<br>
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,<br>
Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
</p>
<p class="drama">
AMIENS.<br>
I would not change it. Happy is your grace,<br>
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune<br>
Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE SENIOR.<br>
Come, shall we go and kill us venison?<br>
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,<br>
Being native burghers of this desert city,<br>
Should in their own confines with forked heads<br>
Have their round haunches gored.
</p>
<p class="drama">
FIRST LORD.<br>
Indeed, my lord,<br>
The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,<br>
And in that kind swears you do more usurp<br>
Than doth your brother that hath banished you.<br>
Today my lord of Amiens and myself<br>
Did steal behind him as he lay along<br>
Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out<br>
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood;<br>
To the which place a poor sequestered stag,<br>
That from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt,<br>
Did come to languish; and indeed, my lord,<br>
The wretched animal heaved forth such groans<br>
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat<br>
Almost to bursting, and the big round tears<br>
Coursed one another down his innocent nose<br>
In piteous chase. And thus the hairy fool,<br>
Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,<br>
Stood on th’ extremest verge of the swift brook,<br>
Augmenting it with tears.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE SENIOR.<br>
But what said Jaques?<br>
Did he not moralize this spectacle?
</p>
<p class="drama">
FIRST LORD.<br>
O yes, into a thousand similes.<br>
First, for his weeping into the needless stream:<br>
“Poor deer,” quoth he “thou mak’st a testament<br>
As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more<br>
To that which had too much.” Then, being there alone,<br>
Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:<br>
“’Tis right”; quoth he, “thus misery doth part<br>
The flux of company.” Anon a careless herd,<br>
Full of the pasture, jumps along by him<br>
And never stays to greet him. “Ay,” quoth Jaques,<br>
“Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens!<br>
’Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look<br>
Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?”<br>
Thus most invectively he pierceth through<br>
The body of the country, city, court,<br>
Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we<br>
Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse,<br>
To fright the animals and to kill them up<br>
In their assigned and native dwelling-place.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE SENIOR.<br>
And did you leave him in this contemplation?
</p>
<p class="drama">
SECOND LORD.<br>
We did, my lord, weeping and commenting<br>
Upon the sobbing deer.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE SENIOR.<br>
Show me the place.<br>
I love to cope him in these sullen fits,<br>
For then he’s full of matter.
</p>
<p class="drama">
FIRST LORD.<br>
I’ll bring you to him straight.

DUKE FREDERICK.<br>
Can it be possible that no man saw them?<br>
It cannot be! Some villains of my court<br>
Are of consent and sufferance in this.
</p>
<p class="drama">
FIRST LORD.<br>
I cannot hear of any that did see her.<br>
The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,<br>
Saw her abed, and in the morning early<br>
They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
</p>
<p class="drama">
SECOND LORD.<br>
My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft<br>
Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.<br>
Hesperia, the princess’ gentlewoman,<br>
Confesses that she secretly o’erheard<br>
Your daughter and her cousin much commend<br>
The parts and graces of the wrestler<br>
That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;<br>
And she believes wherever they are gone<br>
That youth is surely in their company.

</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Who’s there?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADAM.<br>
What, my young master? O my gentle master,<br>
O my sweet master, O you memory<br>
Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?<br>
Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?<br>
And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?<br>
Why would you be so fond to overcome<br>
The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke?<br>
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.<br>
Know you not, master, to some kind of men<br>
Their graces serve them but as enemies?<br>
No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master,<br>
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.<br>
O, what a world is this, when what is comely<br>
Envenoms him that bears it!
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Why, what’s the matter?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADAM.<br>
O unhappy youth,<br>
Come not within these doors! Within this roof<br>
The enemy of all your graces lives.<br>
Your brother—no, no brother, yet the son—<br>
Yet not the son; I will not call him son—<br>
Of him I was about to call his father,<br>
Hath heard your praises, and this night he means<br>
To burn the lodging where you use to lie,<br>
And you within it. If he fail of that,<br>
He will have other means to cut you off;<br>
I overheard him and his practices.<br>
This is no place; this house is but a butchery.<br>
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADAM.<br>
No matter whither, so you come not here.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,<br>
Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce<br>
A thievish living on the common road?<br>
This I must do, or know not what to do.<br>
Yet this I will not do, do how I can.<br>
I rather will subject me to the malice<br>
Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADAM.<br>
But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,<br>
The thrifty hire I saved under your father,<br>
Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,<br>
When service should in my old limbs lie lame,<br>
And unregarded age in corners thrown.<br>
Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,<br>
Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,<br>
Be comfort to my age. Here is the gold.<br>
All this I give you. Let me be your servant.<br>
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty,<br>
For in my youth I never did apply<br>
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,<br>
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo<br>
The means of weakness and debility.<br>
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,<br>
Frosty but kindly. Let me go with you.<br>
I’ll do the service of a younger man<br>
In all your business and necessities.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
O good old man, how well in thee appears<br>
The constant service of the antique world,<br>
When service sweat for duty, not for meed.<br>
Thou art not for the fashion of these times,<br>
Where none will sweat but for promotion,<br>
And having that do choke their service up<br>
Even with the having. It is not so with thee.<br>
But, poor old man, thou prun’st a rotten tree,<br>
That cannot so much as a blossom yield<br>
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.<br>
But come thy ways, we’ll go along together,<br>
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent<br>
We’ll light upon some settled low content.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ADAM.<br>
Master, go on and I will follow thee<br>
To the last gasp with truth and loyalty.<br>
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore<br>
Here lived I, but now live here no more.<br>
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,<br>
But at fourscore it is too late a week.<br>
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better<br>
Than to die well and not my master’s debtor.

bid him take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing
of her batlet, and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked; and
I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods,
and, giving her them again, said with weeping tears, “Wear these for my sake.”
We that are true lovers run into strange capers. But as all is mortal in

“Good morrow, fool,” quoth I. “No, sir,” quoth he,<br>

Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;<br>
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel<br>
And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br>
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br>
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br>
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br>
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,<br>
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br>

Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,<br>
In fair round belly with good capon lined,<br>
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br>
Full of wise saws and modern instances;<br>
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<br>
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,<br>
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,<br>
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide<br>
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,<br>

<p class="drama">
CORIN.<br>
And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that
it is a shepherd’s life, it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like
it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in
respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in
the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour
well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach.
Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CORIN.<br>
No more but that I know the more one sickens, the worse at ease he is; and that
he that wants money, means, and content is without three good friends; that
the property of rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat
sheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that
hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes
of a very dull kindred.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CORIN.<br>
No, truly.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Then thou art damned.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CORIN.<br>
Nay, I hope.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Truly, thou art damned, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CORIN.<br>
For not being at court? Your reason.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good manners; if thou never
saw’st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin,
and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CORIN.<br>
Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the court are as
ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at
the court. You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands.
That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Instance, briefly. Come, instance.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CORIN.<br>
Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells, you know, are greasy.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat? And is not the grease of a mutton as
wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say.
Come.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CORIN.<br>
Besides, our hands are hard.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A more sounder instance,
come.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CORIN.<br>
And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you
have us kiss tar? The courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Most shallow man! Thou worm’s meat in respect of a good piece of flesh
indeed! Learn of the wise and perpend. Civet is of a baser birth than tar, the
very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CORIN.<br>
You have too courtly a wit for me. I’ll rest.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man! God make incision in thee,
thou art raw.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CORIN.<br>
Sir, I am a true labourer. I earn that I eat, get that I wear, owe no man hate,
envy no man’s happiness, glad of other men’s good, content with my harm; and
the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together and
to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a
bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old,
cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match. If thou be’st not damned for this,
the devil himself will have no shepherds. I cannot see else how thou shouldst
’scape.

</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
And why not the swift foot of time? Had not that been as proper?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with divers persons. I’ll tell
you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal, who time gallops withal, and
who he stands still withal.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and
the day it is solemnized. If the interim be but a se’nnight, time’s pace is so
hard that it seems the length of seven year.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Who ambles time withal?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout; for the
one sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
he feels no pain; the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the
other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These time ambles withal.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Who doth he gallop withal?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he
thinks himself too soon there.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Who stays it still withal?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term and term, and then
they perceive not how time moves.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Where dwell you, pretty youth?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
With this shepherdess, my sister, here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe
upon a petticoat.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Are you native of this place?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a
dwelling.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
I have been told so of many. But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught
me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship too
well, for there he fell in love. I have heard him read many lectures against
it, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offences
as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of
women?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
There were none principal. They were all like one another as halfpence are,
every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I prithee recount some of them.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
No. I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick. There is a man
haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their
barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth,
deifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give
him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you tell me your remedy.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
There is none of my uncle’s marks upon you. He taught me how to know a man in
love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
What were his marks?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an
unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have
not—but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger
brother’s revenue. Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded,
your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you
demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man. You are rather
point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself than seeming the lover
of any other.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Me believe it? You may as soon make her that you love believe it, which I
warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does. That is one of the points
in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth,
are you he that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that
unfortunate he.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a
whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is
that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess
curing it by counsel.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Did you ever cure any so?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress, and
I set him every day to woo me; at which time would I, being but a moonish
youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud,
fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for
every passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women
are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe
him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him;
that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
madness, which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a
nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon me to
wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep’s heart, that there shall not be one
spot of love in ’t.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I would not be cured, youth.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my
cote and woo me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Go with me to it, and I’ll show it you; and by the way you shall tell me
where in the forest you live. Will you go?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
With all my heart, good youth.

Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?

When a man’s verses cannot be understood, nor a man’s good wit seconded with

reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.
</p>
<p class="drama">
AUDREY.<br>
I do not know what “poetical” is. Is it honest in deed and word? Is it a true
thing?
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to
poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said, as lovers, they do feign.
</p>
<p class="drama">
AUDREY.<br>
Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?

I do, truly, for thou swear’st to me thou art honest. Now if thou wert a poet,
I might have some hope thou didst feign.
</p>
<p class="drama">
AUDREY.<br>
Would you not have me honest?
</p>
<p class="drama">

No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for honesty coupled to beauty is to
have honey a sauce to sugar.

</p>

Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods make me honest.

unclean dish.

I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.

Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness may come hereafter.
But be it as it may be, I will marry thee. And to that end I have been with Sir

Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt, for
here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what
though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said, “Many a
man knows no end of his goods.” Right. Many a man has good horns and knows no
end of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting.
Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer hath them as huge as
the rascal. Is the single man therefore blessed? No. As a walled town is more
worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honourable
than the bare brow of a bachelor. And by how much defence is better than no
skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want.

<p class="drama">
PHOEBE.<br>
Why, that were covetousness.<br>
Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;<br>
And yet it is not that I bear thee love;<br>
But since that thou canst talk of love so well,<br>
Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,<br>
I will endure, and I’ll employ thee too.<br>
But do not look for further recompense<br>
Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.
</p>
<p class="drama">
SILVIUS.<br>
So holy and so perfect is my love,<br>
And I in such a poverty of grace,<br>
That I shall think it a most plenteous crop<br>

That the main harvest reaps. Loose now and then<br>
A scattered smile, and that I’ll live upon.

<p class="drama">
PHOEBE.<br>
Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
</p>
<p class="drama">
SILVIUS.<br>
Not very well, but I have met him oft,<br>

PHOEBE.<br>
Think not I love him, though I ask for him.<br>
’Tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well.<br>
But what care I for words? Yet words do well<br>
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.<br>
It is a pretty youth—not very pretty—<br>
But sure he’s proud, and yet his pride becomes him.<br>
He’ll make a proper man. The best thing in him<br>
Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue<br>
Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.<br>
He is not very tall, yet for his years he’s tall;<br>
His leg is but so-so, and yet ’tis well.<br>
There was a pretty redness in his lip,<br>
A little riper and more lusty red<br>
Than that mixed in his cheek. ’Twas just the difference<br>
Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.<br>
There be some women, Silvius, had they marked him<br>
In parcels as I did, would have gone near<br>
To fall in love with him; but for my part<br>
I love him not nor hate him not; and yet<br>
I have more cause to hate him than to love him.<br>
For what had he to do to chide at me?<br>
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black,<br>
And now I am remembered, scorned at me.<br>
I marvel why I answered not again.<br>
But that’s all one: omittance is no quittance.<br>
I’ll write to him a very taunting letter,<br>

I will be bitter with him and passing short.<br>

<p class="scenedesc">
Enter <span class="charname">Rosalind, Celia</span> and
<span class="charname">Jaques</span>.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JAQUES.<br>
I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
They say you are a melancholy fellow.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JAQUES.<br>
I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows, and betray
themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JAQUES.<br>
Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Why then, ’tis good to be a post.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JAQUES.<br>
I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which is emulation; nor the
musician’s, which is fantastical; nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the
soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s, which is politic; nor the
lady’s, which is nice; nor the lover’s, which is all these; but it is a
melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many
objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, in which my often
rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold
your own lands to see other men’s. Then to have seen much and to have nothing
is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JAQUES.<br>
Yes, I have gained my experience.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me merry
than experience to make me sad—and to travel for it too.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Orlando</span>.</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!
</p>
<p class="drama">
JAQUES.<br>
Nay, then, God be wi’ you, an you talk in blank verse.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Farewell, Monsieur Traveller. Look you lisp and wear strange suits; disable all
the benefits of your own country; be out of love with your nativity, and almost
chide God for making you that countenance you are, or I will scarce think you
have swam in a gondola.
</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit <span class="charname">Jaques</span>.</i>]</p>
<p class="drama">
Why, how now, Orlando, where have you been all this while? You a lover! An you
serve me such another trick, never come in my sight more.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Break an hour’s promise in love? He that will divide a minute into a thousand
parts, and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of
love, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o’ the shoulder, but
I’ll warrant him heart-whole.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had as lief be wooed of a
snail.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Of a snail?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Ay, of a snail, for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head—a
better jointure, I think, than you make a woman. Besides, he brings his destiny
with him.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
What’s that?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for. But
he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Virtue is no horn-maker and my Rosalind is virtuous.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
And I am your Rosalind.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CELIA.<br>
It pleases him to call you so, but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than
you.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday humour, and like enough to
consent. What would you say to me now, an I were your very, very Rosalind?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I would kiss before I spoke.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were gravelled for lack of
matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are out,
they will spit; and for lovers lacking—God warn us—matter, the cleanliest
shift is to kiss.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
How if the kiss be denied?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or I should think my honesty
ranker than my wit.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
What, of my suit?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Then, in mine own person, I die.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six thousand years old,
and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person,
<i>videlicet</i>, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains dashed out with a
Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the
patterns of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had
turned nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he
went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and, being taken with the cramp,
was drowned; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of
Sestos. But these are all lies. Men have died from time to time and worms have
eaten them, but not for love.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind, for I protest her frown
might kill me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I will be your Rosalind in
a more coming-on disposition, and ask me what you will, I will grant it.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Then love me, Rosalind.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
And wilt thou have me?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Ay, and twenty such.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
What sayest thou?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Are you not good?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I hope so.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?—Come, sister, you shall be
the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Pray thee, marry us.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CELIA.<br>
I cannot say the words.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
You must begin “Will you, Orlando—”

</p>
<p class="drama">
CELIA.<br>
Go to.—Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I will.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Ay, but when?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Why now, as fast as she can marry us.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Then you must say “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.”
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
I might ask you for your commission. But I do take thee, Orlando, for my
husband. There’s a girl goes before the priest, and certainly a woman’s
thought runs before her actions.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
So do all thoughts. They are winged.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
For ever and a day.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Say “a day” without the “ever.” No, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo,
December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes
when they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon
over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than
an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for nothing, like
Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry. I
will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou are inclined to sleep.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
But will my Rosalind do so?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
By my life, she will do as I do.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
O, but she is wise.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser, the waywarder. Make
the doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the casement. Shut that, and
’twill out at the keyhole. Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the
chimney.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say, “Wit, whither wilt?”
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Nay, you might keep that check for it till you met your wife’s wit going to
your neighbour’s bed.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her without her
answer unless you take her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot make
her fault her husband’s occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for
she will breed it like a fool.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I must attend the Duke at dinner. By two o’clock I will be with thee again.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would prove. My friends told me
as much, and I thought no less. That flattering tongue of yours won me. ’Tis
but one cast away, and so, come death! Two o’clock is your hour?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Ay, sweet Rosalind.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths
that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise or come one
minute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise,
and the most hollow lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore beware my
censure, and keep your promise.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind. So, adieu.
</p>

Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let time
try. Adieu.

Left on your right hand, brings you to the place.<br>
But at this hour the house doth keep itself.<br>
There’s none within.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
If that an eye may profit by a tongue,<br>
Then should I know you by description,<br>
Such garments, and such years. “The boy is fair,<br>
Of female favour, and bestows himself<br>
Like a ripe sister; the woman low,<br>
And browner than her brother.” Are not you<br>
The owner of the house I did inquire for?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CELIA.<br>
It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Orlando doth commend him to you both,<br>
And to that youth he calls his Rosalind<br>
He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
I am. What must we understand by this?
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Some of my shame, if you will know of me<br>
What man I am, and how, and why, and where<br>
This handkerchief was stained.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CELIA.<br>
I pray you tell it.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
When last the young Orlando parted from you,<br>
He left a promise to return again<br>
Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,<br>
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,<br>
Lo, what befell. He threw his eye aside,<br>
And mark what object did present itself.<br>
Under an oak, whose boughs were mossed with age<br>
And high top bald with dry antiquity,<br>
A wretched ragged man, o’ergrown with hair,<br>
Lay sleeping on his back; about his neck<br>
A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,<br>
Who with her head, nimble in threats, approached<br>
The opening of his mouth. But suddenly,<br>
Seeing Orlando, it unlinked itself<br>
And with indented glides did slip away<br>
Into a bush; under which bush’s shade<br>
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,<br>
Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch<br>
When that the sleeping man should stir. For ’tis<br>
The royal disposition of that beast<br>
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.<br>
This seen, Orlando did approach the man<br>
And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CELIA.<br>
O, I have heard him speak of that same brother,<br>
And he did render him the most unnatural<br>
That lived amongst men.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
And well he might so do,<br>
For well I know he was unnatural.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,<br>
Food to the sucked and hungry lioness?
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;<br>
But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,<br>
And nature, stronger than his just occasion,<br>
Made him give battle to the lioness,<br>
Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling<br>
From miserable slumber I awaked.
</p>
<p class="drama">
CELIA.<br>
Are you his brother?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Was it you he rescued?
</p>
<p class="drama">
CELIA.<br>
Was’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
’Twas I; but ’tis not I. I do not shame<br>
To tell you what I was, since my conversion<br>
So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
But, for the bloody napkin?
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
By and by.<br>
When from the first to last betwixt us two<br>
Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed—<br>
As how I came into that desert place—<br>
In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,<br>
Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,<br>
Committing me unto my brother’s love,<br>
Who led me instantly unto his cave,<br>
There stripped himself, and here upon his arm<br>
The lioness had torn some flesh away,<br>
Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,<br>
And cried in fainting upon Rosalind.<br>
Brief, I recovered him, bound up his wound,<br>
And after some small space, being strong at heart,<br>
He sent me hither, stranger as I am,<br>
To tell this story, that you might excuse<br>
His broken promise, and to give this napkin,<br>
Dyed in his blood, unto the shepherd youth<br>
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
</p>
<p class="right">[<i><span class="charname">Rosalind</span> faints.</i>]</p>

CELIA.<br>
Why, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede!

Be of good cheer, youth. You a man? You lack a man’s heart.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think this was well
counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
This was not counterfeit. There is too great testimony in your complexion that
it was a passion of earnest.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Counterfeit, I assure you.
</p>
<p class="drama">
OLIVER.<br>
Well then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to be a man.
</p>
<p class="drama">

So I do. But, i’ faith, I should have been a woman by right.
</p>
<p class="drama">

Come, you look paler and paler. Pray you draw homewards. Good sir, go with us.
</p>
<p class="drama">

That will I, for I must bear answer back<br>

I shall devise something. But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him. Will
you go?

William, sir.

</p>
<p class="drama">
WILLIAM.<br>
Ay, sir, I thank God.

<p class="drama">

“Thank God.” A good answer. Art rich?

<p class="drama">
WILLIAM.<br>
Faith, sir, so-so.
</p>

“So-so” is good, very good, very excellent good. And yet it is not, it is but
so-so. Art thou wise?
</p>
<p class="drama">
WILLIAM.<br>
Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Why, thou sayst well. I do now remember a saying: “The fool doth think he is
wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.” The heathen philosopher,
when he had a desire to eat a grape, would open his lips when he put it into
his mouth, meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You
do love this maid?
</p>
<p class="drama">
WILLIAM.<br>
I do, sir.
</p>

TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
</p>
<p class="drama">
WILLIAM.<br>
No, sir.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Then learn this of me: to have is to have. For it is a figure in rhetoric that
drink, being poured out of cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty the
other. For all your writers do consent that <i>ipse</i> is “he.” Now, you are
not <i>ipse</i>, for I am he.
</p>
<p class="drama">
WILLIAM.<br>
Which he, sir?
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you clown, abandon—which is in
the vulgar, “leave”—the society—which in the boorish is “company”—of this
female—which in the common is “woman”; which together is, abandon the society of
this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest;
or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy
liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee, or in bastinado, or in
steel. I will bandy with thee in faction; will o’errun thee with policy. I
will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways! Therefore tremble and depart.

<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>

enjoy each other. It shall be to your good, for my father’s house and all the

It is my arm.
</p>
<p class="drama">

Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.

<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your
handkercher?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Ay, and greater wonders than that.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
O, I know where you are. Nay, ’tis true. There was never anything so sudden but
the fight of two rams, and Caesar’s thrasonical brag of “I came, saw and
overcame.” For your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked; no
sooner looked but they loved; no sooner loved but they sighed; no sooner
sighed but they asked one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but
they sought the remedy; and in these degrees have they made pair of stairs to
marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent before
marriage. They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together. Clubs
cannot part them.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
They shall be married tomorrow, and I will bid the Duke to the nuptial. But O,
how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man’s eyes! By
so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how
much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
Why, then, tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
I can live no longer by thinking.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking. Know of me then—for now I
speak to some purpose—that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit. I speak
not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I
know you are. Neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some little
measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and not to grace me.
Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things. I have, since I was
three year old, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not
damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it
out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her. I know into what
straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me, if it appear
not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow, human as she is,
and without any danger.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ORLANDO.<br>
Speak’st thou in sober meanings?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
By my life, I do, which I tender dearly, though I say I am a magician.
Therefore put you in your best array, bid your friends; for if you will be
married tomorrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.

Methought he was a brother to your daughter.<br>
But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born<br>
And hath been tutored in the rudiments<br>
Of many desperate studies by his uncle,<br>
Whom he reports to be a great magician,<br>
Obscured in the circle of this forest.

<p class="drama">
JAQUES.<br>
There is sure another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark.
Here comes a pair of very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Salutation and greeting to you all.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JAQUES.<br>
Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have
so often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he swears.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. I have trod a measure; I
have flattered a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine
enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have
fought one.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JAQUES.<br>
And how was that ta’en up?
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JAQUES.<br>
How seventh cause?—Good my lord, like this fellow?
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE SENIOR.<br>
I like him very well.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
God ’ild you, sir, I desire you of the like. I press in here, sir, amongst the
rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear according as
marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favoured thing,
sir, but mine own; a poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in
your foul oyster.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE SENIOR.<br>
By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
According to the fool’s bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JAQUES.<br>
But, for the seventh cause. How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
Upon a lie seven times removed—bear your body more seeming, Audrey—as thus,
sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard. He sent me word if I
said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is called the
“retort courteous”. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would send
me word he cut it to please himself. This is called the “quip modest”. If again
it was not well cut, he disabled my judgement. This is called the “reply
churlish”. If again it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true. This
is called the “reproof valiant”. If again it was not well cut, he would say I
lie. This is called the “countercheck quarrelsome”, and so, to the “lie
circumstantial”, and the “lie direct”.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JAQUES.<br>
And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
I durst go no further than the lie circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the
lie direct; and so we measured swords and parted.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JAQUES.<br>
Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
</p>
<p class="drama">
TOUCHSTONE.<br>
O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as you have books for good manners. I
will name you the degrees: the first, the retort courteous; the second, the
quip modest; the third, the reply churlish; the fourth, the reproof valiant;
the fifth, the countercheck quarrelsome; the sixth, the lie with circumstance;
the seventh, the lie direct. All these you may avoid but the lie direct and
you may avoid that too with an “if”. I knew when seven justices could not take
up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but
of an “if”, as, “if you said so, then I said so;” and they shook hands, and
swore brothers. Your “if” is the only peacemaker; much virtue in “if.”
</p>
<p class="drama">
JAQUES.<br>
Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? He’s as good at anything, and yet a fool.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE SENIOR.<br>
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he
shoots his wit.

Let me have audience for a word or two.<br>
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,<br>
That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.<br>
Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day<br>
Men of great worth resorted to this forest,<br>
Addressed a mighty power, which were on foot<br>
In his own conduct, purposely to take<br>
His brother here and put him to the sword;<br>
And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,<br>
Where, meeting with an old religious man,<br>
After some question with him, was converted<br>
Both from his enterprise and from the world,<br>
His crown bequeathing to his banished brother,<br>
And all their lands restored to them again<br>
That were with him exiled. This to be true<br>
I do engage my life.
</p>
<p class="drama">
DUKE SENIOR.<br>
Welcome, young man.<br>
Thou offer’st fairly to thy brother’s wedding:<br>
To one his lands withheld, and to the other<br>
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.<br>
First, in this forest let us do those ends<br>
That here were well begun and well begot;<br>
And after, every of this happy number<br>
That have endured shrewd days and nights with us<br>
Shall share the good of our returned fortune,<br>
According to the measure of their states.<br>
Meantime, forget this new-fall’n dignity,<br>
And fall into our rustic revelry.<br>

With measure heaped in joy to th’ measures fall.

<p class="drama">
ROSALIND.<br>
It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue, but it is no more
unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it be true that good wine
needs no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine
they do use good bushes, and good plays prove the better by the help of good
epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue nor
cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not furnished like
a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My way is to conjure you, and
I’ll begin with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men,
to like as much of this play as please you. And I charge you, O men, for the
love you bear to women—as I perceive by your simpering, none of you hates
them—that between you and the women the play may please. If I were a woman, I
would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me, complexions that liked
me, and breaths that I defied not. And I am sure as many as have good beards,
or good faces, or sweet breaths will for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,
bid me farewell.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
